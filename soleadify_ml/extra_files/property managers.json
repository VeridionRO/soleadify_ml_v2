Since her early days at an agency in the Riverina region, Jody has worked in various areas of real estate, including administration, training and management. These roles have provided an in-depth knowledge and a broad skill set that contributes towards Jody being a highly valued Client Relationship Specialist.\nIn December 2016, Jody celebrated her 10 year anniversary with Taylors. Jody loves the area, beaches and being out in the community to meet clients and tenants to discuss their property needs. Her commitment to Taylors is evident in the long-term professional relationships Jody has established with clients, tenants and tradespeople.\nJody is well established in the Eastern Suburbs and enjoys spending downtime with friends, animals and finding ways to improve her home. Jody is just as proactive as her role at Taylors. Not only does she make things happen, but she continues to look for ways to make a positive difference every day.\nJody s key to success in real estate is quite simple she loves what she does. She also enjoys the vibrant team oriented culture at Taylors and the sharing of knowledge on a daily basis.\nJody has seen a lot of positive growth and development within Taylors over the years, from a team of 3 property managers in 2006 to our current team of 12 specialists focused solely on being the leading providers of property management services in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. Jody has consistently demonstrated exceptional behaviour and the delivery of a premier property management service. She conducts all business with the highest degree of honesty and fairness.\nJody O Brien has conducted herself in a very professional manner and has worked to maintain and manage our residential investments to a high standard. She also has excellence in understanding of market rents and how to achieve those prices. I would recommend her to any property investor - Patrick, Terravest Pty Ltd and Crinhound Pty Ltd, Randwick \nJody O Brien has managed a number of our investment properties for our families for many years. During that time we have never had any issues and the properties have all improved all around under her guidance. When a problem does present Jody fixes it without any fuss to both the landlord and tenant. She is the most efficient, conscientious, and professional property manager we have dealings with - Robyn Crago & families, Coogee \nJody O Brien is a highly competent professional manager of property, one I hope that you will never lose from Taylors. Jody has consistently leased my properties to good tenants, by which I mean tenants who look after the rented home, not treating it as though rented property can be maltreated and who unfailingly pay the rent by the due date. I can say without hesitation that, over many years of owning property, Jody O Brien is by far the most competent Property Manager I have known - Bill Widerberg, Bondi Junction \nI have rented a few properties from Jody O Brien over the past 15 years and I have found her to be very professional and friendly. She is always available to find me the perfect place to live when needed, as she knows what my requirements are. I would highly recommend Jody to anyone that is looking for a home to live or would like their property looked after by the most extraordinary property manager in the area. As I always look after the home I am living in, she praises me at every inspection she carries out on how wonderful I take care of the property. Again, highly recommended - Grant Aylett-Clews \nJody took over the management of our rental property when she joined Taylors 12 years ago and we have been very happy with her service. She has a good understanding of the tenants and of us. She has reliable tradesmen performing quality work. Her annual inspections keep our properties in good condition. She handles any problems with dignity and success. I am delighted to recommend her - S Humphrey, Paddington \nI have been associated with Jody O Brien of Taylors Property Management Specialists for many years. Over this time she has provided the property group, of which I was manager, with innumerable tenants for their various residential properties in the Eastern Suburbs, and continues to do so. In more recent years, she also manages properties for my wife and myself. Now being retired and living in the country, it is reassuring to know that our Sydney investments are well looked after. I have always been happy with the professional service and advice given by Jody . \nMy late Mother, Margaret Butt and I bought a unit in Dine Street, Randwick. We have been extremely happy with Taylors management of the property and specifically Jody s efficiency and brilliant support while looking after it for us. Thank you Taylors and especially Jody, for managing the property and finding us great tenants. We appreciate it - Diana Duff \nI have just moved into a Taylors rental property and am very happy. The service has been very helpful and prompt, and the whole process has gone very smoothly, and the property condition reporting has been very thorough. Have spoken to Jody O Brien about a couple of minor condition issues and she has been very responsive. Have recommended Taylors Property Management Specialists to friends - Peter Hempstead \nTaylors Property Management Specialists has managed our property for the last 31 years and I rate Jody O Brien as the best and most efficient of all the managers Taylors has ever had. Nothing is too much for her. Whether it s arranging repairs or finding a good tenant for the landlords, she ll get it done promptly and professionally. She is well liked by both landlords and tenants. Of all the would-be landlords looking for a property manager, I would not hesitate to nominate Jody. She comes highly recommended - Joe Chan, Randwick \nJody O Brien was recommended to us by our neighbour and has lived up to her fine reputation. Jody knows her trade exceptionally well and has managed our rental property for over 12 months. Jody is quick to inform us of any issues relating to our property tenants and equally as efficient ensuring whatever needs doing gets done. We would highly recommend Jody to anyone looking for a friendly, hardworking and well respected Property Manager - Di & Rupert, Coogee \nI would like to share my experience with everyone on my services and dealings with Jody O Brien and Taylors Property Management Specialists. Jody has been managing my portfolio of properties for the past 16 years and I have found her to be very professional and proactive in all that she performs. I receive my routine inspection reports each year along with rent reviews and any recommendations required, which keeps me in the loop and my properties in good order. I have family that also has properties managed by Jody and everything seems to run seamlessly. There would be no hesitation for me to recommend Jody and Taylors to any investor and or tenant, as I know that they will receive the highest level of service and great communication - John Vaneris \nJody has been managing my rental property in Bronte for five years now. She is highly efficient and professional. She understands the market very well and is willing to take time to learn her clients needs. I travel a lot for work and personal reasons and it is truly great to have Jody as my manager. I know I can rely on her when I m away.

After having family friends and her father working in the industry this was a no brainer. In 2010, Megan and her husband moved to Brisbane to further their careers. During this time Megan excelled in her passion of Property Management and her love for helping exceed clients expectations.\nIn 2013 Megan and her husband built their first home, and this has greatly helped her in having an appreciation for maintaining her owners biggest assets.\nDuring this time Megan has worked extremely hard, constantly self improving and training, and guiding other work colleagues in the right direction. She has experienced all facets in property management, from reception, leasing, BDM and is now a Senior Investment Manager. This has given her the experience she needs to correctly guide her clients in the right direction and knowledge of this industry. Megan s passion for training, being highly organised, honest and friendly has resulted in her being a very well respected Senior Manager in her field. In 2016, the highlight of her career to date, was being nominated as Property Manager of The Year out of a select few in Queensland.\nIn Megan s down time, she enjoys spending quality time with her family and friends and two cats, Issy and Jassy.\nTestimonials\nWhat are people saying about us \nZoe Pacholli\nWorking with Megan and Amanda has been very easy and efficient, they are very reliable.

\nNicholas Markotich Property Manager http: www.beesnees.com.au about-us team nicholas-markotich \nWe re a property firm that specialises in Brisbane s inner city A real estate agency where service isn t a vague promise A team of professional property management, sales and marketing personnel who stand out of the crowd for their local knowledge and fresh approach. We know Brisbane city inside out \nEvery agency makes huge claims for itself but we d prefer you read about our track record from the people who really matter - our landlords and seller clients http: www.beesnees.com.au testimonials .

With over 10 years experience as a Client Relationship Specialist, Marco looks at the bigger picture when dealing with challenges and is not afraid to try new strategies and ideas to find the best property management solution specific to each situation.\nMarco joined Taylors in May 2017 and shares our passion for innovation, improvement and looking to make a difference every day. Whether saving money for a landlord without compromising the property, or recommending improvements at minimal expense, Marco explains the benefits to the client and how the cost will improve the financial return.\nMarco enjoys the character that is present in properties in the Eastern Suburbs and that his clients understand the importance of being strategic in growing wealth through property investment. With a history of uncovering the potential in property and working with clients to gain the best return on their portfolio, the Eastern Suburbs is the ideal location for Marco to excel.\nWhen not assisting clients with building their wealth through property, Marco loves his sports, great food and all things car and motorbike related. You will often find him dabbling in the kitchen, preparing new dishes for his young family.\nMarco is committed to dealing with people with professionalism and integrity. He is passionate about property and finding new ways to improve properties for his clients. He thrives in the friendly team oriented, open-minded culture at Taylors and is aligned with our philosophy that property management is more than collecting rent and fixing taps it is about providing a complete property management solution to investors and tenants.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and gratitude for the helpful and efficient assistance and advice provided to me by my property manager, Marco Afonso. Marco has always dealt promptly and sympathetically with any problems or queries I have had. In my opinion, he is a valuable asset to your organisation - Trevor Stegman, Coogee \nThank you Marco Afonso for making our rental experience hassle free. It s rare to find a property manager so easy and proficient to deal with - Jackie Maitland, Greenwich \nReally happy with the service provided by Marco. Very prompt in any questions or requests we had and generally very easy to deal with. Thoroughly recommend - V Spassov, Randwick \nMarco Afonso, Client Relationship Specialist, has been a pleasure to deal with. Issues in and around the apartment that I have raised with him have been seen to promptly and I have been really happy with the outcome - Susan Honey \nMy partner and I needed to find a house to relocate to NSW from interstate and Marco was super friendly and helpful from the first enquiry. He understood that our preliminary visit would be time sensitive and was gracious enough to adjust his inspection time slightly to suit. Marco was careful to make sure the homeowner was able to know a bit about us, and us about them, which is a nice touch I don t often see. Marco answered any questions I had in a very prompt fashion which took away a great deal of the anxious uncertainty of moving interstate. The day of the big move , Marco went out of his way to make sure I didn t have to do any work, or worry about timings regarding collecting the keys. This was a huge stress relief after a mammoth day. I have never had such amazing customer service from a real estate agent before. I understand that rentals don t generate the greatest revenue in that industry, and often the service is simply satisfactory. Simply not with these guys - Danielle Spicer, Sylvania \nMarco Afonso is one of the best agents I have dealt with. Everything was easy and honest. Would recommend Taylors to anyone looking to rent and Marco in particular - Andrei Belik \nHighly recommend Marco Afonso as a property manager. He made the whole process for us easy and pain free. He went out of his way to help us by staying late and always picking up phone calls which helped us a lot as we work a lot. If you are looking for a hands on property manager who replies quickly and has all the answers, Marco is definitely who I would recommend - Ashlee Finlay, Kensington \nTaylors is truly the best real estate agency I ve ever encountered. They oversaw the last apartment I rented, and over those three years I always found them to be very responsive and transparent. They defy the stereotype of the dodgy and underhanded real estate agent A special shout out to Marco, who is a total legend. He is diligent, helpful and compassionate. I really appreciated his support and sensitivity recently when I was required to move out of the apartment no fault of Taylors, or mine - but a necessity for the landlord .

Opdateringen sker derfor automatisk for hver booking, du modtager, og du undg r overbookinger.\nHverdagen bliver mere effektiv \nDu f r en tovholder med utroligt mange arme. Kasseapparat, online betaling, bordbestilling og timeregistrering er bare nogle af de funktioner, som OCTOPUS ogs d kker. Din hverdag bliver mere effektiv, uanset om du udbyder 10 eller flere hundrede v relser, og dermed har du grundlag for en bedre forretning.\nNem opl ring og god service \nVi har udviklet et brugervenligt system og tilbyder b de dig og dit personale opl ring, s I nemt kan bruge OCTOPUS med det samme. Der er ingen opstartsgebyrer og heller ingen binding. Samtidig yder vi gratis support i almindelig arbejdstid - og besvarer dit opkald inden for 15 sekunder.\nHistorien om OCTOPUS\nOCTOPUS er udviklet af televirksomheden ipnordic A S i Gr sten med direkt r Thorben G. Jensen i spidsen. I marts 2015 k bte selskabet byens tidligere r dhus og omdannede det til hotel og restaurant under navnet DET GAMLE R DHUS. Her opstod id en til et nyt totalsystem, der skulle g re det nemmere og billigere at v re hotelejer.\nThorben G. Jensen var chokeret over, hvor besv rligt og stressende det kunne v re, n r hotellets kapacitet konstant skulle holdes opdateret p alle de store online bookingportaler. Samtidig blev det en kostbar aff re, fordi prisen for booking- og reservationssystemer til b de hotellet og restauranten hurtigt l b op i mange tusinde kroner.

A native of Southern California, Steve relocated to Las Vegas in the early 1980 s and has since established himself as a well respected real estate broker.\nI wanted to create a successful company that would work hand in hand with community leaders.\nWhen he s not working hard, he enjoys spending time with his two children, Hailey and Parker. He also has a passion for racing, which he and his son participate in regularly. Steve supports various causes around the Las Vegas area, including a number of little leagues and United Way in partnership with NV Energy.\nSteve feels strongly about not texting while driving and as a result, entered a partnership with the Nevada Highway Patrol and began the Just Let It Ring campaign.\nsabrina foster.html \nSabrina Foster sabrina foster.html \nOffice Manager, Broker-Salesperson, Permitted Property Manager and Notary Public \n877.WE.RENT callto:1-877-937-3688 \nsfoster@nicklinpm.com mailto:sfoster@nicklinpm.com \nmichelle williams.html \nMichelle Williams michelle williams.html \nNew Accounts Director, Assistant Office Manager, Broker-Salesperson and Permitted Property Manager \n877.WE.RENT callto:1-877-937-3688 \nmwilliams@nicklinpm.com mailto:sabrina@nicklinpm.comafrankfurter@nicklinpm.com \nhillary meeker.html \nHillary Meeker hillary meeker.html \nTeam Leader, Permitted Property Manager and Real Estate Salesperson \n877.WE.RENT callto:1-877-937-3688 \nhmeeker@nicklinpm.com mailto:hmeeker@nicklinpm.com \nLatest Blogs\n04 30 2018\nBest school districts in LV\nblog.html 04 30 2018\nChoosing a Rental Property\nblog.html 04 30 2018\nBuying vs Renting\nblog.html \nUseful Links\nTenant Newsletter tenant newsletter 2018.pdf \nOwner Newsletter owner newsletter 2018.pdf \nBlog blog.html \nCareer Opportunities career.html \nindex.html \nhttps: www.facebook.com nicklinpropertymanagement \nhttps: twitter.com nicklinpm lang en \nhttps: www.linkedin.com company nicklin-property-management-&-investments-inc. \nNicklin Property Management C - Website by:: POWEREDbyMARIO http: www.poweredbymario.com","annotation":[{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":2414,"end":2440,"text":"Nicklin Property Management"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":1907,"end":1927,"text":"hmeeker@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":1878,"end":1898,"text":"hmeeker@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":1862,"end":1875,"text":"1-877-937-3688"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1818,"end":1840,"text":"Real Estate Salesperson"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1787,"end":1812,"text":"Permitted Property Manager"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1774,"end":1784,"text":"Team Leader"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":1738,"end":1751,"text":"Hillary Meeker"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":1637,"end":1659,"text":"mwilliams@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":1621,"end":1634,"text":"1-877-937-3688"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1574,"end":1599,"text":"Permitted Property Manager"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1551,"end":1568,"text":"Broker-Salesperson"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1525,"end":1548,"text":"Assistant Office Manager"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1502,"end":1522,"text":"New Accounts Director"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":1460,"end":1476,"text":"Michelle Williams"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":1413,"end":1433,"text":"sfoster@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":1384,"end":1404,"text":"sfoster@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":1368,"end":1381,"text":"1-877-937-3688"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1334,"end":1346,"text":"Notary Public"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1303,"end":1328,"text":"Permitted Property Manager"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1283,"end":1300,"text":"Broker-Salesperson"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":1267,"end":1280,"text":"Office Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":1231,"end":1244,"text":"Sabrina Foster"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":408,"end":420,"text":"Steve Nicklin"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":385,"end":405,"text":"nicklin@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":356,"end":376,"text":"nicklin@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":342,"end":353,"text":"702-451-8700"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":322,"end":333,"text":"702.451.8700"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":305,"end":320,"text":"Corporate Broker"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":295,"end":299,"text":"Owner"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":281,"end":293,"text":"Steve Nicklin"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":102,"end":111,"text":"7024518700"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":82,"end":93,"text":"702-451-8700"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":71,"end":80,"text":"8779373688"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":29,"end":49,"text":"nicklin@nicklinpm.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":0,"end":20,"text":"nicklin@nicklinpm.com"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551975139000,"last_updated_at":1551975139000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"3BCYEQgDIHTFtTzwIy6Dpeowaae2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

As steady as your revenues. \nBanCal has been managing San Francisco properties with a vigilant commitment to property improvement and professional integrity since 1987. Founder Willliam Baner launched the company on the strength of two decades experience in real estate sales, leasing, property management, renovation and property development. \nAfter ten highly successful years with the company, Tammy McNaught succeeded Baner as BanCal President in 2008. Since taking the reins, Tammy and her team have added 33 new properties to BanCal s management roster and increased building revenues an average of 15 - 18 . \nTeam Bios \nNice to Meet You \nTammy McNaught, President Managing Member BanCal Property Management Founder William Baner handed Tammy the reins in 2008, after she d spent 10 years with the company honing the boutique approach that today accounts for its expansive success. A licensed broker with 15 years leasing and management expertise in San Francisco and a property owner in the city as well, she has plenty of first-hand experience with this unique real estate market. \nWhen she s not leading her team above and beyond the call for BanCal s clientele, Tammy craves exploration and active traveling, from scootering in Uruguay to snowboarding in Tahoe. Her brain candy of choice is fantasy fiction like the Riftwar Saga--a favorite form of escapism. \n--- --- \nLicensed Agent \nDRE: 01840074 \nMichelle Antic, Leasing Agent - Michelle joined BanCal in 2009, bringing to the table more than twelve years of residential real estate marketing and sales experience in the Bay Area. In addition to managing campaigns for more than 75 properties, her experience extends to leasing, sales and escrow management and model home merchandising. \nAn avid international traveler and tracker of the San Francisco restaurant scene, she is also fascinated by architecture, design and construction. Her fantasy is to build a custom home one day. \n--- --- \nLicensed Agent \nDRE: 01313576 \nNorman Ng, Director of Operations An authority on investment sales, consultation and valuation, Norman has helped many San Francisco property owners streamline costs to positively impact the bottom line. Since joining the BanCal team in 2010, he has trained his skill and eye for detail on assisting owners and tenants with smooth building operations. \nWhen he s not perfecting his barbeque technique the secret is slow cooking with lots of smoke , he s working on meeting the goal of visiting at least one new country each year.\n--- --- \nLicensed Agent \nDRE: 01821209 \nSean Rogan, Community Association Manager Sean has been managing HOAs since 2011, advising upwards of fifteen associations with more than 500 units.\nHis experience ranges from insurance claims to defect litigation, with many hours logged in project management. He helped grow a subscription-based web start-up that sourced information to support real estate sales, generating over 1 million unique page views and breaking revenue records. \nAn avid rugby player, Sean played on a Division I college team and now coaches the Berkeley Rhinos high school rugby club. \n--- --- \nSajida Ali, Staff Accountant \nMiguel Arrellano, Property Manager Before coming on board at BanCal in 2015, Miguel was a leasing manager with the single biggest residential property management company in the United States and one of only six company employees in the nation to be recognized for outstanding customer service. Working for a boutique firm like BanCal is a very different experience he welcomes for the opportunity to get to know tenants personally.\nA great cook who started young, Miguel is famous for his Mexican ceviche, his most-requested dish for parties and family get-togethers.\n--- --- \nLicensed Agent \nDRE: 01917595 \nAlvin Donaire, Community Association Manager In 2011, the same year he began his career in property management, Alvin was inspired by Ultra Runner Dean Karnazes to take up long-distance running. Both endeavors changed him significantly, inspiring him to challenge himself consistently in his personal and professional lives. One recent challenge met was earning certification from the California Association of Community Managers in 2015.\nWhen he s not managing a portfolio of homeowner associations for BanCal or training for a marathon, Alvin volunteers with a nonprofit organization that gives free guitar lessons to at-risk youth. \n--- --- \nKelli Smith, Senior Property Manager A San Francisco native, Kelli has been working in real estate here since her part-time job in high school. After twenty years in title and escrow, she made the move to property management in 2010, quickly earning the trust of her clients and proving herself a capable manager of an extensive roster of rental properties. \nKelli is a Notary Public, a fraternal twin and is deeply committed to serving the community through fundraising and volunteer work for the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Arthritis Foundation and the Shanti Project. \n--- --- \nLicensed Agent \nDRE: 01879500 \nDiana Loo, Assistant Property Manager Diana grew up in Puerto Rico and went to college in Florida, where she first worked in real estate as an administrative assistant. Seeing property management up close made her want to go that direction herself. Since moving to San Francisco, she has held assistant property manager positions at two other firms in the city. Diana came to BanCal eager to learn, take on greater responsibility and grow into a more senior role.\nA science fiction fan, she is binge-watching her way through the Star Trek generations. She pines for her favorite Puerto Rican foods. \n--- --- \nManagement Services services.php Leasing leasing.php Available Rentals renals.php Properties property.php Our Team team.php Testimonials testimons.php Contact contacts.php Resident Portal https: bancalsf.appfolio.com connect users sign in Webmaster http: www.cwp4a.com \n2009-2016 BanCal Property Management. \n220 Jackson Street 3rd Floor San Francisco, CA 94111 Tel: 415 397-1044 info@bancalsf.com \nhttp: www.ppmaofsf.org Professional Property Management Association of San Francisco https: www.caionline.org Pages default.aspx Community Association Institute http: sfaa.org http: www.napw.com \n---","annotation":[{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":6808,"end":6824,"text":"info@bancalsf.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":6795,"end":6806,"text":"415 397-1044"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6708,"end":6733,"text":"BanCal Property Management"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5830,"end":5855,"text":"Assistant Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5819,"end":5827,"text":"Diana Loo"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5788,"end":5801,"text":"Licensed Agent"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5215,"end":5237,"text":"Senior Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5202,"end":5212,"text":"Kelli Smith"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":4572,"end":4600,"text":"Community Association Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":4557,"end":4569,"text":"Alvin Donaire"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":4526,"end":4539,"text":"Licensed Agent"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3931,"end":3946,"text":"Staff Accountant"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3919,"end":3928,"text":"Sajida Ali"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3358,"end":3386,"text":"Community Association Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3346,"end":3355,"text":"Sean Rogan"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3315,"end":3328,"text":"Licensed Agent"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2787,"end":2808,"text":"Director of Operations"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":2776,"end":2784,"text":"Norman Ng"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2745,"end":2758,"text":"Licensed Agent"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2216,"end":2228,"text":"Leasing Agent"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":2200,"end":2213,"text":"Michelle Antic"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2169,"end":2182,"text":"Licensed Agent"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":1477,"end":1502,"text":"BanCal Property Management"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":1435,"end":1448,"text":"Tammy McNaught"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":1187,"end":1200,"text":"Tammy McNaught"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551975139000,"last_updated_at":1551975139000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"3BCYEQgDIHTFtTzwIy6Dpeowaae2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

After realizing that I was pretty much breaking-even and spending a lot of time, I finally decided to give it a shot. Coming up on my 3rd year working with Heirloom Property Management, I am now their biggest fan. Not only were they able to increase my rents to cover their fees, their in-house construction team has saved me a bunch of money and put my properties on a proactive maintenance schedule to help avoid costly emergency repairs that were eating-up my profits. To anyone who owns a rental property in Duluth, I would highly recommend that you give them a call and see what they can do for you.\n- Andy Weitnauer, L.W. Rentals, LLC \nMy wife and I had been wanting to get into real estate investing for a long time. We don t live in Duluth and didn t want those late night repair calls associated with property management, So we knew that we needed to find a trust worthy property manager. As newbies to real estate investing we needed someone to guide us on where to buy and how to rent. Mike and the rest of the Heirloom team were a perfect match. They helped us every step of the way and enabled us to close on two properties and get them rented in the first half of 2015. We are very satisfied with Heirlooms quality, professionalism, and devotion to our investments and are looking forward to continuing to expand our real estate empire with Heirloom. \n- Tom & Steph Lantry \nC 2019 Heirloom Property Management Duluth MN https: rentwithheirloom.com &dash All Rights Reserved","annotation":[{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":12282,"end":12309,"text":"Heirloom Property Management"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":11043,"end":11070,"text":"Heirloom Property Management"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":10681,"end":10700,"text":"HeirloomPM@gmail.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":10647,"end":10672,"text":"admin@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":10633,"end":10644,"text":"218-390-4317"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":10616,"end":10627,"text":"218-390-4317"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":9853,"end":9873,"text":"Lead Maintenance Tech"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":9840,"end":9849,"text":"Jacob Bunt"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":9265,"end":9285,"text":"Lead Maintenance Tech"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":9248,"end":9261,"text":"Tim VanHolbeck"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":9211,"end":9231,"text":"Lead Maintenance Tech"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":9196,"end":9207,"text":"Blake Condon"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":8784,"end":8806,"text":"Maintenance Coordinator"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":8419,"end":8441,"text":"Maintenance Coordinator"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8401,"end":8415,"text":"Christian Junes"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":7437,"end":7451,"text":"Project Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7424,"end":7433,"text":"Loren Auch"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5801,"end":5817,"text":"Senior Accountant"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5784,"end":5797,"text":"Zach Steinhoff"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5301,"end":5316,"text":"Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5284,"end":5297,"text":"Kaitlyn Murphy"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":4785,"end":4808,"text":"ben@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":4747,"end":4769,"text":"Senior Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":4734,"end":4743,"text":"Ben Graham"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":4177,"end":4206,"text":"kimberlee@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":4140,"end":4162,"text":"Senior Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":4127,"end":4136,"text":"Kim Grogan"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":3441,"end":3465,"text":"dana@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3404,"end":3426,"text":"Senior Property Manager"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3388,"end":3400,"text":"Dana Morrison"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":2166,"end":2190,"text":"nick@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2129,"end":2151,"text":"Construction Supervisor"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":2116,"end":2125,"text":"Nick Adams"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":808,"end":832,"text":"mike@rentwithheirloom.com"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":785,"end":793,"text":"President"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":764,"end":781,"text":"Michael Schraepfer"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9,"end":20,"text":"218-390-4317"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551975139000,"last_updated_at":1551975139000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"3BCYEQgDIHTFtTzwIy6Dpeowaae2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Accepting a Property Manager position, Caitlin believes the support of a dedicated administrative team, along with the back up of efficiency-based technologies, allows her to focus solely on delivering a personalised service to all her clients.\nA positive attitude teamed with the determination to exceed expectations, Caitlin also has an ability to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life which forms a perfect fit for MRE s internal culture of support, nurturing and development. Caitlin is focussed on expanding her skill-set to eventually advance her real estate career into other areas.\nCaitlin s valuable time off involves catching up with family, getting out and about in the great outdoors or the occasional girls night out on the town. Caitlin spends her down time snuggling on the couch watching Netflix or hanging out with Honey, her beloved canine companion. And, efficient as she undoubtedly is, it s worth noting that nothing gets done before Caitlin downs her first cup of English Breakfast tea each day\nCaitlin O'Keeffe can be contacted at, caitlin@melbournerealestate.com.au (mailto:caitlin@melbournerealestate.com.au)\nTestimonials\nCaitlin O'Keeffe is my property manager.

The only way short-term letting can be restricted is by council planning regulations.\nA government spokesperson also highlighted that by-laws telling owners that they must abide by local council zoning restrictions are invalid as only local councils can enforce their zoning.\nThe local council, owns, the zoning regulation,, says the spokesperson,, Only they can enforce it.\nFair Trading has already amended its, Strata Living handbook (https: www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au __data assets pdf_file 0008 367946 FT-045-Strata_Living_Guide.pdf) to warn owners corporations and strata committees that they can t pass by-laws restricting holiday lets.\nWhat does that mean for owners and investors of apartments in building complexes with Short Term Rental bans\nAs these bans are declared invalid, you are now able to freely choose between long or short-term rental options without checking on the by-laws of the building. Or, if you plan to rent out your apartment whilst on holiday, you can now do so without restrictions from by-laws.\nIt was also made clear by Fair Trading that, in case of violation like overcrowding, noise or disruption of other occupants, complaints can be taken to the Tribunal to impose penalties.\nQuirin Schwaighofer, Co-founder and COO of MadeComfy says _ We welcome this statement as rather than banning short term rental in general, the recommended way is to deal with non-complying property owners and guests. At MadeComfy (https: madecomfy.com.au ) we care a lot about our owners and guests, but also about their neighbours and community and hence we have even stricter house rules in place than most by-laws do. We also enforce these rules strictly and have a 24 7 service to act on violations. _\nHow do local councils deal with Short Term Letting\nSome councils have restrictions on short term letting, however, currently they are only enforced on a complaint basis. A spokesperson for City of Sydney Council, where residential letting is defined as three months or more, said they had very few complaints, two of which were currently being actively pursued.\nThe City of Sydney reviews all complaints about illegal activity to determine what compliance action is needed. Priority is given to breaches that involve health or fire safety concerns,, said the spokesperson., The City carefully addresses all reports about short-term letting but has received complaints from only a small number of people.\nA Waverley spokesperson said:, Where Council receives complaints that relate to the illegal use of a premises for short-term letting, including via Airbnb, council officers undertake an investigation that usually involves an inspection and making contact with the owner of the premises .\nThese statements highlight the importance that you manage your guests and short-term rental proactively with a clear way of communicating and enforcing strict house.\nThe NSW government recently released a, Short-term Holiday Letting in NSW Options paper (http: www.planning.nsw.gov.au media Files DPE Other short-term-holiday-letting-options-paper-20-July-2017.ashx) for the discussion of regulating short term letting on a state rather than council basis.\n_If you have any further questions about this announcement and the feasibility of undertaking short-term letting in your strata building, feel free to get in touch with us and we're happy to explain or answer any further questions you might have._\n( hs cta cta redirect 2946894 7bcb1829-ee79-4ee4-87e2-5fefe09014e3)\n(http: madecomfy.com.au)\nMadeComfy\nYour Home (http: www.madecomfy.com.au your-home )\nProperty Investor (https: madecomfy.com.au investment-property )\nConcierge (https: madecomfy.com.au concierge-services )\nContact Us (https: madecomfy.com.au contact )\nContact Us\nMadeComfy\nL3 80 Bay Street\nUltimo, NSW 2007\n1800 526 133\nKeep in Touch\nEnter your email below to subscribe to our blog\n(https: www.youtube.com channel UC3PiaK-2yQ7oB-Sosn_vdXQ) (https: www.linkedin.com company 6611306) (https: twitter.com MadeComfyau) (https: www.instagram.com madecomfyau) (https: www.facebook.com 1634251680149267)\n2019 MadeComfy","annotation":[{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":4937,"end":4948,"text":"1800 526 133"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2395,"end":2397,"text":"COO"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":2380,"end":2389,"text":"Co-founder"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":2359,"end":2377,"text":"Quirin Schwaighofer"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":359,"end":377,"text":"Quirin Schwaighofer"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551975140000,"last_updated_at":1551975140000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"3BCYEQgDIHTFtTzwIy6Dpeowaae2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

For us at GormanKelly, it is more than that.\nSo what is commercial property management\nCommercial property management is helping investors maximise the value of their investment by developing asset strategies that look to the future while considering current values and factors.\nManaging commercial properties also means minimising property capital expenditure by putting a solid maintenance lifecycle plan to forecast expenses while ensuring costly building compliance issues are avoided.\nEfficient commercial property management is making it easy for our investors to access financial reports and legal documents to save them time and money on accounting and legal services.\nMost of all, it is making sure that their commercial real estate investment assets experience stability so the little details of commercial property management won't wear them down.\nThese are solid processes that we create to ensure we deliver the best commercial property management service for our clients. And as they grow in their investment journey, we provide them guides, tips, insights, and updates on Melbourne's commercial property industry and how it impacts the management of their assets.\nHere's a collection of commercial real estate management guides and tips that we want to share with you.

The building is at 116 W. Sixth St. on the north side of Bloomington s courthouse square.\nIt was built in 1915 and was the home of the Wicks Bee Hive Department Store until 1976. CFC purchased it in 1995. Today, the building s ground floor holds VIP Nails, Gallery 406 and Royale Hair Parlor.\nIt also has about 6,000 square feet of space available on its second floor and 6,000 square feet available on its third floor.\nThe space, going for a price of, 12 per square foot, opened up after the government contractor Technology Service Corp. moved to the west side of Bloomington. Technology Service Corp. moved earlier this year after occupying the space for more than two decades, according to Chris Cockerham, CFC s vice president of commercial real estate.\nIt was individual offices,, Cockerham said., We went in and opened the whole thing up. We re seeing a trend for large open space for tech companies so they can have more collaborative space.\nCFC is actively searching for a company or companies to move into the floors. It showed off the second- and third-floor Wicks space Thursday during an open house.\nThe second floor is a large open area book ended between large windows at the front and back. It has a mix of wood and carpeted floors, along with black ceilings and black support beams.\nThe third floor is also mostly open, although it has a few more walls and some offices. It s currently less finished than the second, with an exposed brick wall in the back and unfinished wood floors.\nCFC decided to try to fill the vacated space with technology tenants because tech companies often bring in higher-wage workers. Such workers can boost the overall economy in downtown Bloomington, Cockerham said.\nPlus, the architecture has the right vibe.\nWhen you see the space, it just feels like what tech companies are looking for,, Cockerham said., Big tall ceilings. It s a unique space.\nDecember isn t a bad time to lease commercial space, Cockerham added. Many companies want to get leases in place before the first of the year.\nCFC has shown the Wicks space to several companies and is, currently courting, a company for the third-floor space, he said.\nCockerham also believes some technology companies are feeling better about the economy and are ready to expand.\nIt feels like the economy is getting its footing, at least from my perspective,, he said.\nFiled Under:, In The News (https: cfcproperties.com category news )\nReader Interactions\nComments\n1., What happens if the stock market crashes (https: tacticalinvestor.com the-scary-stock-market-crash-that-experts-are-overhyping ) says\nFebruary 2, 2019 at 11:01 am (https: cfcproperties.com cfc-looks-for-tech-firms-to-fill-downtown-office-space comment-11017)\nYou should take part in a contest for one of the best blogs on the web.

Drost, MPM, RMP , has been an investor and property manager since 1990. Tony has a BA Degree in Operations Management and holds two professional designations offered by the National Association of Residential Property Managers .\nOne fact that makes First Rate Property Management different from all others is that Tony is an investor too. Tony has the proven formula for financial success through investing in real estate. Although Idaho does not require licensing of property managers, Tony is a real estate broker with Swope Investment Properties and assists his clients in buying and selling of rental properties. To learn more about Tony's real estate sales, please visit his Boise Investment Properties website. Because Tony is so active in rental investments, Tony manages your property as if it were his own. Tony instills this perspective to all First Rate Property Management employees.\nFirst Rate Property Management's property-to-employee ratio is approximately 60 properties managed per employee. Call around and you will find that many companies have a property-to-employee ratio of over 100 properties managed per employee and, in some cases, as high as one person to every 200 properties managed. The difference likely is not the lack of good systems on First Rate Property Management's part -- our systems are top-notch, proven and reliable -- but rather more about the personal time we devote to each of our valued clients and tenants. First Rate Property Management personally shows each of our properties with a leasing agent, whereas not all do. As a result, First Rate Property Management is able to attend to our tenant and client needs very quickly.\nPlease review our guarantee and learn more about our education and qualifications that make us one of the best.\nMission:, Our well trained, committed, and valued team provides genuine care for the properties we are entrusted to professionally manage.\nVision:, Maintain recognition as one of the most knowledgeable property management companies within our market, through continuous improvement.\nMeet the Team\nLauren Kern, Leasing | Office Support Team Member\nAs the Office Support Team Member of First Rate Property Management, it is my job to coordinate customer service at the front desk. I direct incoming calls to the best person to meet your needs. I also answer your questions about our available rental properties and schedule showings. I apologize in advance if you call and the auto attendant picks up. This means that I and all of the other leasing agents are all on the phone assisting others. To meet your needs, First Rate Property Management has created a very interactive website. Our rental listing includes photos and specific descriptions of each property. You can even apply online. If you prefer, feel free to email any of us. Thank you\n208-321-1900 x112, Reception@frpmrentals.com (mailto:Reception@frpmrentals.com)\nBrianne Schultz, Office Support Team Member\nBri is First Rate s, Jack-of-all-trades, She has been with First Rate since October 2018 and has quickly become a part of the family.

Julie is eager to educate herself, others, and to get involved however possible.\nJulie enjoys spending time with her friends & family, a relaxing puzzle or two in the winter, a hike or two in the summer, but there is nothing quite like binge watching Friends on Netflix.

I have also had the opportunity to work with dozens of property management companies over the years. In fact, while still living here in Fort Washington, Maryland, three years ago I purchased a single family home in Charlotte, North Carolina. From experience, living in one state and owning properties in another state can be a pure nightmare. I knew nothing about the rental market in the North Carolina area. However, after encountering many bad experiences with the previous property manager, I hired Carolinas Metro Realty. I will confess, they are the best thing that ever happened to me. They provide the hands-on property management expertise that I was looking for. They are extremely professional. They have been wonderful with tenant screening, quick feedback, and follow up and reporting. I am so pleased with Carolinas Metro Realty that I have recommended them to all my friends, as well as other fellow investors.\nIrene Robertson\nWhat People Are Saying About CMR\nAnnie H.\nI've been using CMR for a little over 2 years and they've really taken the burden of renting my home off of me.

Usually, the option agreement allows the renter to purchase the home at any time or at certain time intervals (after three years of paying timely rent, for example) by serving the owner of the home with written notice of his intent to exercise the option. Generally, the option agreement also gives the renter the right of first refusal, which means that the owner of the house cannot sell it to a third party unless the renter has first been offered and declined to exercise the option to buy. Typically, upon signing the contract, the renter must pay the owner a non-refundable lease option deposit. The option can be drafted so that there is only certain time period during which it can be exercised (30 days after the first of the year, for instance) or so that it expires completely after a period of years.\nThere are many advantages to leasing with an option to purchase for both the buyer and the seller. Because the terms of a lease purchase agreement typically apply some rent paid to the cost of purchasing the home, the seller is essentially financing the purchase of the home. This allows the buyer to purchase a house without an extensive credit and finance check, and the seller to sell her home quickly and still get all or nearly all of her asking price (this is especially beneficial during a sluggish market).\nDepending on the market, the buyer can negotiate lower rent (in exchange for making higher mortgage payment later) or the seller can negotiate higher rent because he is basically financing a purchase. (This aspect really depends on the negotiating skills of the respective parties). As well, such a contract is relatively risk-free for both sides. The first right of refusal clause prevents the owner from selling the house out from under the renter. The option deposit and time limits allow the owner to still make a sale if the renter is unable or unwilling to purchase the home.\nHow much rent can I get for my house condo duplex apartment\nRental rates are directly related to competing units in the immediate area and other factors. Any of our Property Investment Managers will be glad to assist with this very important question via phone (704-405-0634) or e-mail ManagementInquiry@CarolinasMetro.com.\nWhat is CMR's Collection Procedures\nMajority of our properties have rent due on the 1st of the month and late on the 6th. First notices are mailed on the 6th of each month or next business day. Second notices are mailed on the 10th of each month or next business day. With prior owner's approval, court cases are initiated against all delinquent residents on the 21st of each month. Note that due to our rigorous screening and consistent collection procedures, evictions are rare at CMR.\nWhen does an owner get his her check\nYou will not have to wait on your monthly rental proceeds, we make every effort to insure your funds are received no later than the 15th of the current month. Direct deposit of an owner's monthly check is available at no additional charge. In addition, the property owner will receive an itemized accounting statement for each property and invoices we paid that month on owner s behalf.\nWho holds the Security Deposit(s)\nN.C. General Statutes require that security deposits be segregated from other funds and held in a separate escrow account in a bank or savings & loan. CMR maintains all security deposits in a separate escrow account and is the fiduciary under N.C. General Statutes. The security deposit cannot be disbursed to anyone until a resident vacates and then it can only be disbursed to either the owner or the previous resident.

In addition to prior approval, it is also important to obtain the proper permits and inspections.\nCan I paint, hang wallpaper\nPerhaps, however, you will need our approval prior to beginning any project. You may be required to return the property to its original condition upon move out.\nCan I pay my rent online\nYes you can, Payment can be made from your bank savings or checking account and should be done at least 48 hours prior to payment due date. Login information and your password will be emailed to you by move-in date.\nHow do I call if I have a maintenance issue\nYou can call our office at 704-405-0634, or you can make a maintenance request online through the, TENANT PORTAL (https: app.propertyware.com pw portals carolinasmetro tenant.action). We do monitor phone calls and emails nights and weekends in case of emergencies. All maintenance issues must go through our office. If you call a repairman yourself, you will not be reimbursed.\nMy children have been begging me for a pet\nWhen I signed the lease it said no pets allowed. What do I do, It depends on whether pets are allowed on the property. It could be as simple as paying the pet fee and amending your lease. Call our office to discuss. 704-405-0634.\nMy job is transferring me to another state, but I still have 6 months on my lease. What do I do\nUnfortunately, you are responsible for making rental payments through the end of the lease. However, if we are able to find a new tenant, then you can be released from further obligation.\nMy lease is up and I'm moving out. What do I need to do\nYou are expected to leave the property in the same or better condition it was in when you moved in. At the minimum, you will need to make sure that you have cleaned the kitchen (including appliances and countertops) and bathrooms, that you have swept and mopped floors, carpets are vacuumed, and that all trash has been removed from the property. If carpets are dirty, you will need to have them cleaned. If you have painted, you may need to return them to their original color. Before painting, be sure to patch any holes in the walls caused by hanging pictures, and or any other damaged areas. Doing these things will help us in returning your security deposit more quickly.\nMy lease is up in 3 months, but I love living here, Is it possible to extend my lease\nIn most cases, the answer is yes, In most cases, it is possible to sign a new lease. New terms may apply.\nMy sister and her husband are splitting up. It's OK for her to move in, right\nTypically your lease states that only persons that have signed the lease and their children may occupy the premises without prior approval. In this case, an additional person may be allowed, but we will need to do criminal screening on anyone over the age of 18.\nWhen will I receive my deposit\nYour security deposit will be returned to you within 30 days of moving out of the property, less any cost of repairs. If there are damages to the property, then the cost of repairs will be deducted before returning the balance to you. You cannot skip paying last month's rent and use your security deposit for payment.\nWho takes care of the lawn\nIn most cases, lawn care is the responsibility of the tenant. Grass must not be allowed to become unsightly. Any penalties or assessments caused by tenant s failure to keep the lawn and landscaping properly maintained will be passed along to the tenant.\nJohn recently joined Gordon Property Management s maintenance team. He works with Alen in repairing and maintaining residential real estate for GPM's clients.\nMessages for John can be left with Nanette at (415) 554-8812 x 202 or by Email: maintenance@gpmsf.com\ncontact-form-7 id 1063, title Agreement\ncontact-form-7 id 1033, title Free Rental Analysis Lead Capture","annotation":[{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":30323,"end":30343,"text":"maintenance@gpmsf.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":30289,"end":30302,"text":"(415) 554-8812"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":30256,"end":30259,"text":"John"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":30105,"end":30130,"text":"Gordon Property Management"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":30084,"end":30087,"text":"John"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":27889,"end":27900,"text":"704-405-0634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":27279,"end":27290,"text":"704-405-0634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":25206,"end":25217,"text":"919-715-7000"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":22112,"end":22123,"text":"704-336-2211"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":21838,"end":21849,"text":"704-594-9400"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":21723,"end":21734,"text":"704-594-9400"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":20973,"end":20984,"text":"704-594-9400"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":20858,"end":20869,"text":"704-594-9400"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":20287,"end":20298,"text":"704-594-9400"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":19998,"end":20011,"text":"(704) 665-5826"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":19978,"end":19988,"text":"17044050634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":19957,"end":19970,"text":"(704) 405-0634"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":16899,"end":16934,"text":"ManagementInquiry@CarolinasMetro.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":16875,"end":16886,"text":"704-405-0634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":10715,"end":10725,"text":"17043438842"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":10694,"end":10707,"text":"(704) 343-8842"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":10451,"end":10480,"text":"Carolinas Management Resources"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":10029,"end":10051,"text":"info@CarolinasMetro.com"}]},{"label":["EMAIL"],"points":[{"start":9996,"end":10018,"text":"info@CarolinasMetro.com"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9983,"end":9993,"text":"17046655826"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9962,"end":9975,"text":"(704) 665-5826"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9949,"end":9959,"text":"17044050634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9927,"end":9940,"text":"(704) 405-0634"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8036,"end":8044,"text":"George V."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7526,"end":7532,"text":"Adam H."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":6768,"end":6775,"text":"Annie H."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":6719,"end":6733,"text":"Irene Robertson"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":20,"end":33,"text":"1-704-405-0634"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":0,"end":13,"text":"(704) 405-0634"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551975140000,"last_updated_at":1551975140000,"sec_taken":0,"last_updated_by":"3BCYEQgDIHTFtTzwIy6Dpeowaae2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Bohl and Samantha C. Flanzer\nCMS issued a, Request for Information (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid d9b0584e-739c-458d-bd5b-77c65f2db191&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.federalregister.gov 2fdocuments 2f2018 2f06 2f25 2f2018-13529 2fmedicare-programs-request-for-information-regarding-the-physician-self-referral-law) (RFI), seeking input from the public on how best to address and mitigate any, undue regulatory impact and burden, of the physician self-referral law ( Stark Law ). The RFI, filed on June 20, 2018, signals a willingness on the part of CMS to consider revisions of the Stark Law to accommodate new payment models. While the RFI is largely focused on the intersection of the Stark Law and care coordination models, it also seeks public input on potential changes to core tenants of the Stark Law, e.g., regarding the definition of, commercial reasonableness, and when compensation should be considered to, take into account other business generated, between parties to an arrangement.\nHighlights of those areas CMS is requesting public input include:\nTo what extent the Stark Law currently impacts commercial alternative payment models, and to what extent additional Stark Law exceptions may be necessary to protect such arrangements\nThe current utility of the risk-sharing arrangement Stark Law exception\nTo what extent it may be prudent for CMS to add a, special rule for compensation under a physician incentive plan, within the current Stark Law personal services arrangements exception\nPossible approaches to defining, commercial reasonableness, and, fair market value\nWhen compensation should be considered to, take into account the volume or value of referrals, by a physician or, take into account other business generated, between parties to an arrangement (both inside and outside the context of alternative payment models)\nWhat barriers exist to qualifying as a, group practice, under the Stark Law\nHow CMS could interpret the exception for remuneration unrelated to designated health services (DHS) to cover a broader array of arrangements, and\nThe role of transparency in the context of the Stark Law, (e.g., how transparency about a physician's financial relationship may reduce or eliminate harms to the Medicare program and its beneficiaries that the Stark Law is intended to address).\nWhile this is certainly not the first time CMS has requested public input on potential revamps to the Stark Law, this RFI may nonetheless signal increasing momentum for Stark Law reform within the government.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid d9b0584e-739c-458d-bd5b-77c65f2db191&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fcms-signals-willingness-to-revamp-stark-for-coordinated-care-efforts)\nAbout the Authors\nKristin M.

Update (https: www.pmiboise.com wordpress index.php 2018 06 21 june-washington-d-c-update )\nHeading into the summer, Congress has remained focused on completing the national defense authorization bill, appropriations for Fiscal Year 2019 (FY 2019), and advancing legislation to address opioid abuse. Lawmakers are eager to demonstrate action prior to the upcoming midterm elections, prompting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to issue a statement canceling the majority of the Senate's August recess. At the same time, the Trump Administration continues to generate major news on immigration, foreign policy, and trade, including the recent high-profile summit between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un and new tariffs announced on China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. The Administration has also continued to promote its drug-pricing plan and recently released new widely anticipated regulations on association health plans.\nIn this month's Washington, D.C.

The NDAA authorizes a base defense budget of, 639 billion for the Department of Defense and national security programs at the Department of Energy. The NDAA also authorizes, 69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. Next, a joint conference committee will meet to resolve differences between the House and Senate bills, a process House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-TX) hopes to finish by the end of July.

The new AHPs will not be subject to the full coverage or non-discrimination requirements under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), allowing these plans more flexibility on benefit designs and premiums. The Administration and Republican lawmakers argue that expanding AHPs will provide cheaper alternatives for small businesses and self-employed individuals that have struggled to find affordable options in the ACA's insurance exchanges. However, Democrats, state regulators, and many health care stakeholders warn that expanding AHPs is likely to drive up premiums in the ACA's insurance exchanges by siphoning off younger and healthier consumers.\nBaker Donelson issued an overview of the new regulations on AHPs on June 20, available, here (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2ftrump-administration-releases-regulations-to-expand-association-health-plans-1).\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the new regulations will result in approximately four million additional individuals enrolling in AHPs by 2023, including approximately 400,000 previously uninsured individuals. However, CBO also projects that due to the new regulations on AHPs and Short-Term Limited Duration Insurance Plans, average premiums will increase two to three percent in the ACA insurance exchanges.\nHouse Passes First Appropriations Bills of the Cycle, Rescissions Package Passes House, Senate Prospects Unclear (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fhouse-passes-first-appropriations-bills-of-the-cycle-rescissions-package-passes-house-senate-prospects-unclear)\nOn Friday, June 8, the House passed a roughly, 147 billion three-bill FY 2019 spending package on a 235 to 179 vote, overcoming Democratic objections to environmental policy riders and funding priorities in the GOP-drafted Energy-Water title. The, minibus,, which also includes the Military Construction-VA and Legislative Branch measures, is the first of what House GOP leaders expect to be a series of three-bill packages to try to expedite passage of at least a few of the 12 annual spending bills before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. On final passage, 16 Republicans crossed the aisle to vote, no, on the package, but these votes were outweighed by 23 Democratic votes in favor of the minibus.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fhouse-passes-first-appropriations-bills-of-the-cycle-rescissions-package-passes-house-senate-prospects-unclear)\nOpioids Focus in Congress: House Passes Dozens of Opioids Bills, Senate Finance and HELP Committees Advance Draft Legislation (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fopioids-focus-in-congress-house-passes-dozens-of-opioids-bills-senate-finance-and-help-committees-advance-draft-legislation)\nGiven broad interest in addressing opioid abuse and growing public pressure, both the House and Senate are considering a broad range of bills designed to address opioids, with lawmakers working to pass legislation during the summer to demonstrate action before the midterm elections.\nThe House passed 39 opioids-related bills last week, including incremental measures to reduce excess and unused prescription opioids in circulation, increase access to addiction treatment and alternative pain treatments, restrict imported fentanyl arriving through international mail, and expand coverage for telehealth treatment for substance use disorder. The House advanced most of the bills by a voice vote. On June 14, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) and Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-MA), and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR) and Ranking Member Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ) introduced H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act. House Leadership intends for H.R. 6 to serve as the underlying vehicle for the majority of House-passed bills on opioids. The House has continued voting on dozens of additional proposals this week and aims to wrap up the focus on opioids legislation, including voting on H.R. 6, by the end of the week.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fopioids-focus-in-congress-house-passes-dozens-of-opioids-bills-senate-finance-and-help-committees-advance-draft-legislation)\nAzar Targets Drug Rebates and Medicare Part B for Drug Pricing Policy Changes (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fazar-targets-drug-rebates-and-medicare-part-b-for-drug-pricing-policy-changes)\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has continued to promote and expand on the Trump Administration's new Drug Pricing Blueprint through media appearances and congressional testimonies over the past several weeks.\nIn a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on June 12, Azar called particular attention to the idea of eliminating drug rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and encouraging a pricing system, where PBMs and drug companies just negotiate fixed-price contracts., Under the current system, drug manufacturers set initial list prices and PBMs negotiate discounts or rebates down from those list prices. Azar contended that eliminating drug rebates and using fixed-price discounts would better incentivize companies to set lower list prices. Azar believes HHS has the regulatory authority to eliminate rebates in Medicare Part D. Replacing the drug rebate system with a fixed-price contract system may have major implications for the drug industry. There is uncertainty regarding the details of how a fixed-price contract system would operate and whether the Trump Administration could implement such a change without Congress.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fazar-targets-drug-rebates-and-medicare-part-b-for-drug-pricing-policy-changes)\nTrade Tensions Escalate After Trump Administration Imposes Steel and Aluminum Tariffs on Allies and Technology Tariffs on China (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2ftrade-tensions-escalate-after-trump-administration-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-allies-and-technology-tariffs-on-china)\nOn Thursday, May 31, President Trump announced he would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, triggering immediate retaliation from U.S. allies and protests from American businesses and farmers. The tariffs, 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, took effect at midnight that night, marking a major escalation of the tension between the United States and its top trading partners. Stung by the U.S. action, the allies quickly hit back. The E.U. stated it would impose import taxes on politically sensitive items like bourbon from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky. Mexico said it would levy tariffs on American farm products, while Canada zeroed in on the same metals that Trump had targeted.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2ftrade-tensions-escalate-after-trump-administration-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-allies-and-technology-tariffs-on-china)\nDepartment of Justice's Stance on Legal Challenge to ACA Reignites Fight over Protections for Pre-Existing Conditions (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fdepartment-of-justices-stance-on-legal-challenge-to-aca-reignites-fight-over-protections-for-pre-existing-conditions)\nOn June 7, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a legal brief in support of a lawsuit from 20 states seeking to invalidate the Affordable Care Act (ACA), urging the federal court considering the case to strike down the ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions. The Texas-led lawsuit,, Texas v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, , claims that Congress's recent elimination of the ACA's individual mandate penalty means that the individual mandate is now unconstitutional. As a result, the plaintiffs argue that the entire statute is now invalid because the individual mandate is central to the law. The Trump Administration agreed in its filing that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and claims that the federal court should also strike down the ACA's guaranteed issue and community rating provisions because those provisions are too closely tied to the individual mandate. In a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged that the executive branch typically defends existing federal law, but stated that this is a, rare case where the proper course, is to forgo a defense.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fdepartment-of-justices-stance-on-legal-challenge-to-aca-reignites-fight-over-protections-for-pre-existing-conditions)\nDodd-Frank Law Loosened by the House, Volcker Rule Changes Proposed by the Fed (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fdodd-frank-law-loosened-by-the-house-volcker-rule-changes-proposed-by-the-fed)\nOn May 22, by a vote of 258-159, the House approved a Senate-passed bill to free thousands of small and medium-sized banks from strict rules that had been enacted in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank law intended to prevent another financial crisis. The bipartisan passage in both the House and the Senate handed a significant victory to President Trump, who promised to undo the Dodd-Frank regulations. The bill stopped short of unwinding the toughened regulatory regime put in place to prevent the nation's biggest banks from engaging in risky behavior, but it still represents a substantial change to the Obama-era rules governing a large swath of the banking system. The legislation will leave fewer than ten big banks in the United States subject to stricter federal oversight, freeing thousands of banks with less than, 250 billion in assets from the restrictions.\nREAD MORE (https: communications.bakerdonelson.com email_handler.aspx sid 08954e72-c018-40c9-a8cb-db9133ac8e5c&redirect https 3a 2f 2fwww.bakerdonelson.com 2fdodd-frank-law-loosened-by-the-house-volcker-rule-changes-proposed-by-the-fed)\nAbout the Authors\nSheila P.
