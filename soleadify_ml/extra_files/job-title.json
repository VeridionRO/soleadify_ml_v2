Take Stock in Children was founded in the early 1990s to combat the persistent dropout rate that plagued Tampa s public schools. Created by a local education foundation with both public and private funding, it provides scholarships, mentors and comprehensive services for high-potential, low-income students from middle school through high school, and transition to college and careers.\nThrough Take Stock, Brendan was able to attend Saint Leo University, graduating with a 3.84 g.p.a. in 3 years. His interest in civics and government studies led him to choose a career in law, and that led him to enroll in Barry University School of Law in Orlando, graduating in the top 10 of his class.\nWhile studying law at Barry he was a member of the Law Review, and also served as a research assistant for two professors. One summer he interned with Judge Stanley Mills, an esteemed jurist.\nBased on his experience with Take Stock and as a legal intern, Brendan wants to give back to the community in any way possible, including becoming a volunteer Take Stock mentor. He has an abiding desire to help people, and he says his disadvantaged upbringing leads him to be even more compassionate to others.

That s my favorite part of my job. Each client has a story, and I am here to ease their burdens and give them the endings they want. My sister and I are third-generation attorneys. Our father and grandfather both represented working individuals and families never the big insurance companies. We all live by the same motto: You feel good when you do good. \nI began my legal career at one of the largest plaintiffs personal injury firms in Dallas, Texas, ultimately rising to Head of the Product Liability Department. I have litigated against many Fortune 500 corporations, as well as some of the largest international corporations in the world. I have successfully represented minor children, fathers, mothers, and widows in death, paralysis, and brain injury matters, along with deserving folks involved in less serious injuries. I have also successfully represented entire neighborhoods affected by adjoining deep excavation construction projects, damaging oil field work, and disposal methods, as well as against polluters of streams, shores, and neighboring waterways.\nI ve gone up against the biggest companies in the world and won. I ll win for you too. \nIn addition, I filed the first ever product liability lawsuit in the nation to address rollover prevention technology for hazardous liquid cargo carriers, reducing not only 18-wheeler tractor-trailer rollovers but the environmental impact from hazardous toxic spills. Other efforts of mine have resulted in record recoveries for my clients, as well as first ever discovery orders requiring the production of internal corporate documentation in a variety of suits. Today, I pride myself on my specialized experience and almost always represent my clients locally. \nYou might be surprised to learn that I am also a licensed motorcycle operator. I enjoy the thrill of motor and snow sports, as well as big mountain adventures throughout southwestern Colorado. If it has to do with the outdoors, then you can bet that you ll find me there.\nBar & Court Admissions\nColorado Supreme Court \nOklahoma Supreme Court \nTexas Supreme Court \nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Texas \nUnited States District Court, Western District of Texas \nUnited States District Court, Eastern District of Texas \nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Oklahoma \nUnited States District Court, Western District of Oklahoma \nUnited States District Court, Northern District of Alabama \nUnited States District Court, Western District of Tennessee \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims \nSouthern Ute Indian Triable Court\nEducation\nJD - Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, 1993 \nBBA - University of Texas, McCombs School of Business, 1989 \nAssociations & Memberships\nPupil, Patrick E.

{"content": "Utah s Premier Estate and Business Planning Law Firm\n801 980-3401\nSeminar Sign Up Consultation Request\nHome\nOur Services\nEstate Planning Wills, Trusts & Tax Planning \nEstate Plan Reviews\nPlanning for Minor Children\nBusiness Planning\nEstate and Trust Administration\nAbout Us\nWhy Sundance Law\nMeet Our Team\nOur Location\nOur Story\nFAQs\nBlog\nOffers & Events\nTestimonials\nContact Us\nMeet Our Team\nMarianne Ludlow \nFounding Attorney \nI founded Sundance Law Group to help people in Utah secure and protect their families and businesses through proper legal planning, including wills, trusts, powers of attorney, tax minimization, trust administration and business planning. I partner with families and business owners to help them achieve their goals, provide them with financial security and peace of mind, and communicate their values to future generations. While an important aspect of estate planning is passing down your assets to the next generation in the best way possible, it is also about transferring values, traditions, and security. It s about having your assets create new opportunities and leaving the next generation better.\nSundance Law Group is committed to not only drafting a personalized estate plan, but also helping our clients implement it. When I was just out of law school 20 years ago, my grandmother died. While she had a will and trust in place, the attorney had not helped her organize and transfer her assets into the trust. My dad and I spent many late nights locating disorganized assets and navigating probate. Also, even though my grandmother lived frugally, because she also didn t have an ongoing relationship with her attorney, the attorney never addressed tax issues that arose when her assets appreciated, resulting in a large tax at her death.\nProper planning and implementation can help avoid these types of situations and can ease the burden of loved ones during difficult times. I provide my clients with help, education and support with their estate plans so they can achieve their family and business goals and have peace of mind, security and predictability for their loved ones and business.\nEducation \nI attended Brigham Young University and graduated Cum Laude top 10 double majoring in Economics and Political Science. I then attended George Mason University Law School, just outside of Washington D.C., where I graduated in 1997 with High Honors top 10 . I enjoy staying current on cutting-edge estate and business planning practices.\nExperience \nAfter law school and a judicial internship, I practiced Business Law, Estate Planning and Tax Law in a Washington D.C. law firm that focused on the unique needs of small and medium sized business owners. I then served as in-house legal counsel to a technology company where I drafted and negotiated hundreds of contracts and advised the company on legal matters.\nI took a break from practicing law to raise my children. During this time, I continued to take continuing legal education courses to stay up-to-date on estate and business planning issues. I was active in my community including serving on the school community council , PTA Board, Ignite Entrepreneurship Academy Board, and serving as a Mock Trial attorney coach. I also found meaningful opportunities to serve the legal needs of people in my community.\nI founded Sundance Law Group with a goal of helping families in my community secure and protect their families and businesses through legal planning.\nPractice Areas \nI focus on Estate and Business Planning, including Wills, Trusts both revocable and irrevocable , Powers of Attorney, Health Care Directive, Special Needs Trusts and Planning, Asset Protection, Probate and Trust Administration, Tax Planning, Business Formation, and Business Sucession Planning.\nMemberships \nI am a member of the Utah State Bar Estate Planning Section, Utah State Bar Business Law Section and the Utah County Estate Planning Council. I recently received the Avvo Client s Choice award in the areas of Estate Planning and Business Law.\nJENNIFER J. COLWELL \nClient Services Director \nMy Father-in-law passed away in a car accident in 2004. He was only 60 years old. We were devastated by the unexpected loss of such an important person to us and were quickly overwhelmed with what had to be done next. Bless his heart, my darling Dad was a tremendous packrat and had collected barns full of junk on the farm in Northern California. It became my husband s job to pull it all out, sort, value and get rid of most of it This process literally took years. My husband would have nightmares in which he admitted to heated confrontations with his departed father forbidding him to set foot on the ranch again after leaving such a mess \nThankfully, Dad had his financial house in good order when he left. He had engaged competent legal counsel and set up his financial affairs in such a way that things were simple for those of us who cared about him most. We knew exactly where things were, how to access them and what Dad intended for them. For that, our family has been very grateful. \nI am a believer in planning for the future. Life is fragile and unpredictable, but also full of people who mean the world to you. Thoughtful planning and professional support can help you leave your loved ones with security for their future. At Sundance Law Group, our goal is to partner with you throughout your life so that, in the end, you can be assured things will be simple, and that your loved ones will be taken care of the way you intended. \nI graduated from Brigham Young University, Magna Cum Laude top 5 with a degree in Humanities and a Secondary Education Accreditation for Humanities, English and Japanese Language. In my professional life, I have been a teacher, computer systems trainer and executive assistant. But my most important careers have been as a wife to Tom and mother to my 4 kids, as a part of which my roles have included everything from chief cook and bottle-washer, nurse, tutor, and taxi driver, to psychologist, coach, labor manager and negotiator. Families are an adventure \nCYDNEY REEVE \nDirector of Client Relations and Marketing \nCydney joined Sundance Law Group as the Director of Client Relations and Marketing. She brings to this position a broad global background, and a passion for creativity and design. As the mother of 4 girls, she understands and appreciates the need to organize family decisions and family planning. \nCydney s global experience began when her family moved to Singapore. She also had the opportunity to live in Chile. She loves to travel and learn about new countries and cultures.\nCydney graduated from BYU with a BS degree in Human Development. Upon graduation, Cydney was one of the first 10 employees of a local Utah startup that has now grown into a multi-million dollar company. That ignited in her an entrepreneurial spirit and curiosity in startups. Cydney s next job took her to Silicon Valley where she enjoyed working for a fast moving computer software company, organizing and implementing their internal telecommunications. \nFor the next few years, Cydney supported her husband s career which took them to multiple states all over the country. During this time she had 4 daughters and became involved in various church assignments, and school PTA boards. \nAs a long-time friend of Marianne, Cyd jumped at the opportunity to help create and expand Sundance Law Group. Years ago Cydney and her husband had a will and trust created by another attorney that sat untouched for years. She understands the need for family protection and planning and now has a unique perspective on what a thorough job Sundance Law group, and specifically Marianne, do for families looking to secure their future \nCydney enjoys being in the outdoors with her family. They have a passion for hiking, backpacking, cycling and skiing. Cyd is an avid runner, gardener, and do it yourselfer. \nSheri Romney, \nLegal Assistant \nI graduated with Honors and Summa Cum Laude from Oakland Community College with an Associate Degree in Applied Science, Legal Assistant Program American Bar Association Approved degree. I m originally from Detroit, Michigan. \nI have several years of experience working as a legal assistant in law firms and also working in various courts as a civil clerk landlord tenant and small claims , a traffic clerk, tickets, arraignments, marriages, etc and an account clerk the Court s cashier .\nI also travelled the county with the Mitt Romney Presidential campaign in 2011 2012. I loved seeing this great country from north to south and, east to west. It was a wonderful experience to attend debates and meet the Presidential candidates. We also traveled to London to visit expats living abroad and, to Jerusalem, Israel, where I was honored to sit in a Q & A meeting with the Prime Minister. Ever since government class in high school, I have enjoyed politics and the legal field.\nMy parents died when I was a young adult and I was widowed at age 45. I know first-hand the importance of planning for the inevitable.

Mulligan\nBrian T. Mulligan\nCriminal Defense Attorney \nContact Brian Mulligan\nBrian Mulligan was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1996. After receiving his Bachelor s degree in 1991 from the University of Florida, he attended the John Marshall Law School and graduated with his Juris Doctor in 1996. He spent several years prosecuting misdemeanor and felony charges while working for the State Attorney s office in Pinellas and Pasco Counties.\nWhile serving as prosecutor, Brian met Attorney Peter Proly and recognized that he practiced law the way it should be practiced. Peter demonstrated a reasonable approach to the practice of law and had earned a great reputation for honesty and trustworthiness. Pete did not play games. Mr. Proly s ability to see the forest and the trees, as well as spot the issues quickly and cut to the chase was the type of attorney practice that attracted Brian to join the firm, located in Port Richey, Florida, in 2001.\nBrian confirms that he enjoys the practice of Criminal Law. Dealing with people, prosecutors, judges and clients brings enjoyment to every day. Mr. Mulligan sees himself as a problem solver and works in the best interest of each client. When I meet with a client, their situation comes alive and my work with them is very personal. \nFor many years, Brian served as the hearing officer and coordinator for Teen Court in Pasco County. He has participated in the Great American Teach-In in both Pinellas and Pasco Counties. He participates in Criminal Justice Day for Leadership Pasco which Laporte, Mulligan & Werner-Watkins sponsor each year. Brian has served on the Advisory Board and as Acting Chair for the DUI School.\nBrian was a member of the class of Leadership Pasco, 2010 and found this experience to be one of expanding awareness and appreciation of the local community. A great opportunity to learn more about the citizens of Pasco and how our community lives, works and plays. \nBrian has served as a coach for his son s soccer team. He and his family enjoy a once a year vacation to ski in Colorado, Idaho or Montana. In addition to skiing, Brian enjoys pick-up games of basketball and is a golfer.\nBrian is a member of the West Pasco Bar Association, the Florida Justice Association and the Allgood-Altman American Inns of Court.\nAbout Us\nAbout\nMeet the Team\nCommunity Involvement\nFAQs\nContact Us\nFree Consultation\nRequest a Free Consultation\nYour Name required \nYour Email required \nYour Phone required \nDescription of your case: \nPlease leave this field empty.\nPlease leave this field empty.\n11914 Oak Trail Way \nPort Richey, FL 34668\nToll Free: 727 478-4125 \nFax: 727 862-8386\nPopular Links\nHome\nAbout\nCriminal Defense\nPersonal Injury\nBlog\nContact Us\nRecent Posts\nWhat are the Most Common Crimes \nI Was Hit By a Car While Riding My Bike\nIs a Bar Liable if a Drunk Patron Hurts Someone Else or Themselves \nWhat You Should Know About Florida Automobile Insurance\nWhat To Do After a Rollover Car Accident\nRated AV by Martindale-Hubbell The highest rating for legal ability & ethical standard worldwide.\n2017 Laporte, Mulligan & Werner-Watkins \nWebsite created by","annotation":[{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":3283,"end":3316,"text":"Laporte, Mulligan & Werner-Watkins"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":2897,"end":2911,"text":"Personal Injury"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":2880,"end":2895,"text":"Criminal Defense"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":2842,"end":2853,"text":"727 862-8386"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":2823,"end":2834,"text":"727 478-4125"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":1752,"end":1785,"text":"Laporte, Mulligan & Werner-Watkins"}]},{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":291,"end":304,"text":"Brian Mulligan"}]},{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":276,"end":289,"text":"Brian Mulligan"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":241,"end":266,"text":"Criminal Defense Attorney "}]},{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":223,"end":239,"text":"Brian T.

With his personal experience, Mark is able to ease clients minds because he has been in their position on more than one occasion. In addition, this experience gives him a great perspective as an investigator.

They really do care about their clients. Great lawyers, great staff and great legal service. Thanks Jeff for all your help in my settlement \nLiz S. \nGreat people Always there to help and they did not treat me like a paycheck. Mr. Nadrich and Mr. Cohen were very pleasant and always helpful. I would recommend them in your time of need. Always a quick response to calls or emails. \nDavid W. \nRandal Cohen was awesome on my case. I would recommend him to anyone. They did a great job. Thank you Randal Cohen. \nAndy W. \nI am happy I found Nadrich & Cohen. They convinced me that I should not take the insurance company s offer and go forward with a lawsuit.

I would definitely recommend this law firm because here, I actually feel like my case matters. \nJen M. \nWe were lucky enough to have been referred to Nadrich & Cohen by a friend. When we called, we specifically asked for the attorney Jeffrey Nadrich. Within 24 hours, I was in their office meeting with him. He agreed to take our case. They opted to choose mediation, instead of prolonging the process. We were very happy with the outcome, and received full value for our claim. \nMelody C. \nREAD MORE REVIEWS\nWe promise that a member of our team will respond to your free consultation request within 24 hours of submission\nNadrich & Cohen, LLP Civil Justice Scholarship\nDo I Have a Case \nName\nEmail\nPhone\nComments...\nSubmit\nMAIN Office Location\nNadrich & Cohen, LLP 12100 Wilshire Blvd Suite 1250, Los Angeles, CA 90025 310-826-8082\nABOUT US\nFAQs\nCASES WE HANDLE\nARTICLES AND INFO\nTESTIMONIALS\nBLOG \nCASE RESULTS\nCONTACT\nDISCLAIMER: The information gathered from this website is not legal advice.

While formally educated at The University of Texas and Texas Tech University School of Law, his real schooling took place in the county courthouses across West Texas. From 1982 to 1992, Jon tried cases to juries primarily involving on-the-job injuries suffered by working men and women.

During the 35 years of his practice he has acquired the extensive experience necessary to handle virtually any kind of personal injury, oilfield catastrophe or wrongful death case. \nTo give back to the community that has been so good to him, Jon is proud to have served as a special prosecutor for the State of Texas to prosecute police misconduct as well as special assistant for the Disciplinary Counsel of the State Bar of Texas to prosecute attorney misconduct.

After the hearing, my father, dressed in blue jeans and a sweatshirt, stuck out his hand to shake hands with the company s lawyer. The lawyer refused. The lawyer was not upset because my dad got the best of him but because he frowned upon working class people. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. My dad used this story to remind me to respect others, to remember where I came from and as an example of how not to conduct myself as a lawyer. \neric t. chaffin\nAdvocates for the injured...\nAt Chaffin Luhana LLP, we are experienced trial lawyers with proven track records, and many recoveries in the millions of dollars for individual clients in New York City, the Greater Pittsburgh Area, West Virginia, and Nationwide.\nDoing good by doing right. \nOur Offices\nNew York\n600 Third Ave., 12th Flr., New York, NY 10016 get directions\nPittsburgh\n615 Iron City Dr. Pittsburgh, PA 15205 get directions\nWest Virginia\n3200 Main St. Weirton, WV 26062 get directions\nPhone 888.480.1123\nFax 888.317.2311\nC 2019 Chaffin Luhana LLP.

It is hard to understand the legal process and the rights that you have. We are doing our best work when we help a client fully understand their situation and provide confidence knowing they have an experienced legal team determined to help and achieve results.\nYou may feel confused, alone or judged by the system. You will not have to convince STERN Law that you deserve the best representation possible and a positive, successful result. There is good in all of us, despite even our biggest mistakes, and we are proud to serve as your most trusted counsel. We work hard to turn your seemingly impossible situation into a manageable strategy with a clear, focused plan of action. STERN Law will help you see the light at the end of this dark tunnel.\nToo many attorneys forget that their clients are entrusting them with their lives.

Communication and understanding is critical to an effective attorney-client relationship and positive results.\nCopyright 2018 Stern Law LLC. All Rights Reserved.

Christina also helps non-U.S. Citizens achieve legal status in the United States to pursue their dreams and stay united with their families. Christina believes that everyone deserves a chance to be a part of this great country, especially when a person works so hard to make it happen. \nIn her spare time, Christina enjoys yoga being outdoors traveling with her fianc and Georgia football. \nChristina is admitted to the Bar in the State and Superior Courts of Georgia, Georgia Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of Georgia.\nGabriel Pino, Immigration Paralegal\nGabriel Pino originally joined STERN Law in 2015 and served as our Immigration Paralegal through January 2017.

Rodriguez-Cera, 274 P.3d Colo. 2012 \nUniversity of Colorado School of Law: Latino Law Students Association, Outstanding Latino Law Student\nLet us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate. \nJohn F. Kennedy\nThe personal injury attorneys at the Bendinelli Law Firm have many years of experience negotiating and litigating personal injury, wrongful death, slip and fall and motor vehicle accident cases throughout the state of Colorado. \nWhile in law school at the University of Colorado, Blaine Milne served as both treasurer and vice-president of the Latino Law Students Association and was elected Outstanding Latino Student upon graduation. \nBoth before and after law school, Blaine Milne gained 17 years of experience working for insurance companies, evaluating and settling both personal injury and property damage claims. Mr. Milne s work history has given him the unique opportunity of knowing how insurance companies evaluate personal injury claims, including car, motorcycle and bus accidents. This experience has afforded Mr. Milne and The Bendinelli Law Firm the benefit of how to effectively present a personal injury case in order to maximize the case s value. Mr. Milne has personal experience with how insurance companies set policies, which result in unfair treatment to both claimants and their own clients. Mr. Milne receives great satisfaction when he can help those who have been injured through no fault of their own facing such obstacles. \nMr. Milne also assisted Mr. Marco F. Bendinelli in successfully winning a substituted service case before the Colorado Supreme Court. Willhite v. Rodriguez-Cera, 274 P.3d Colo. 2012 . The case overturned an earlier trial court ruling that required the defendant to be personally served in Mexico, which was impracticable due to bureaucratic and corruption problems in Mexico which were recently exacerbated due to the drug war problems in the area of Mexico where the defendant resided. The Colorado Supreme Court agreed with Mr. Bendinelli and Mr. Milne that under the circumstances proper substituted service could be made through a close family member of the defendant who still resided in Colorado but maintained frequent contacts with the defendant. The Colorado Supreme Court s decision not only allowed the client s case to go forward, which resulted a quick settlement of the policy limits of the responsible driver after the Colorado Supreme Court s ruling, but the case also exemplifies the diligence the attorneys at the Bendinelli law firm will pursue in order to obtain the maximum settlement possible for its clients. \nWhen not helping personal injury victims receive fair compensation for their injuries, Mr. Milne enjoys traveling to Mexico to visit his family. He is a self-proclaimed movie geek and an avid Denver Bronco fan.\nCriminal Defense \nInformation Center\nDUI While Impaired Traffic\nDomestic Violence\nAssault\nTheft Robbery Burglary\nDrug Offenses\nJuvenile Crimes\nViolent Crimes\nWeapons Charges\nContact Us \nComplete the form below to receive a complimentary consultation.\nBlog \nRecent Posts\nMarch 17, 2016 \nOutstanding Job Done by M...\nApril 23, 2014 \nWelcome to Our New Websit...\nMore Recent Posts\nThe Bendinelli Law Firm, P.C.

Nice\nOVERVIEW\nAn Indiana native, Robert J. Nice has practiced law in Indiana for three decades. With a legal career that began in 1985, he focuses his practice in the areas of Real Estate Small Business Business Litigation General Litigation Legal Malpractice and Plaintiffs Personal Injury.\nFollowing law school Robert Nice was employed as an associate with a large Indianapolis law firm for six years before establishing his own firm in 1992. Utilizing his undergraduate degree, he also worked as a pharmacist before becoming an attorney and on a part time basis for several years thereafter.\nTALK TO BOB\nA PERSONAL NOTE FROM BOB NICE\nWhen I graduated from law school in 1985, I did what all of the graduates were told to do. I went to work for a big law firm. As a consequence, I spent my days in the library or alone in my office writing briefs and responding to motions. I never saw clients.\nAfter six years, I d had enough. I knew what to do I just didn t want to wait around for several years to have a chance to do it so, I resigned and went off on my own.\nSince our firm s inception in 1992, we have focused on providing our clients with personal attention, whether in a courtroom or an office setting. I particularly enjoy working with investors and small business owners. As a real estate investor, as well as an attorney, I have started and managed several small businesses over the years and fully understand the sacrifices business owners make and the effort they put forward to keep their businesses in operation. It requires a great effort and can provide great satisfaction.\nI invite you to call me personally to discuss how we can assist you in resolving the legal matters which you encounter in your life and in your business.

Working for Mr. Larmoyeux since 1981, Charles maintains a thorough understanding of medical negligence law and how it applies to accident victims. Prior to starting with Larmoyeux & Bone, Charles worked for insurance companies as a licensed insurance adjustor from 1971-1983, where he was investigating and determining coverage and then settling insurance claims of all types auto, bodily injury, property damage, etc. \nThen, instead of mitigating losses, he switched sides and began helping victims of negligence to receive a full and just compensation for their losses.

Charles then obtains a medical chronology of events from them in order to determine if they have suffered substantial and permanent bodily injuries as a consequence of a healthcare provider s negligent act or omission.\nCharles handles the intake and investigation, as cases are valid only when the injury arises as a consequence of the breach of applicable standard of care. Following the intake process, Charles conducts the investigations. As such, he obtains medical records, speaks to experts, and interviews witnesses and, coordinates retaining expert witnesses in order for the case to be fully investigated upfront.\nWhy Larmoyeux & Bone \nCharles is passionate about his work because he likes helping people who have been wronged due to medical negligence. Through his work, he is able to see accident victims win their cases and receive just compensation. Through his many years in the legal field, Charles has come to understand that when you take good care of your clients, the attorney fees take care of themselves.\nPlease be aware that contingency fees give everybody legal access to skilled trial lawyers, an integral part of what sets Larmoyeux & Bone apart from other personal injury lawyers in the South Florida area.

The six are American women of the Muslim faith, and they have started what they believe is a first-of-its-kind law firm. They hope to change the way others think about their religion and culture, as well as the way law can be practiced.\nThe pictures you see in the media of Muslim wom en are of very shrouded, very oppressed women,, says Janaan Hashim., That is not us, not what our faith advocates. We have a great opportunity to overcome the odds in a very pluralistic, very accepting society.\nLaunched last fall, the Amal Law Group in Palos Heights, Ill., is named after the Arabic word for hope, the partners say. The firm represents their hope for themselves and their community., Today the word Muslim has a very negative conno tation, and we are trying to overcome that,, Hashim says.\nMuch like the varied ethnicities of Amal s partners, a variety of matters are handled by the firm, including criminal defense and business law. While they don t exclusively cater to Muslims, the partners say their combined knowledge of American jurisprudence and Islamic law and culture has created a demand for their services in their growing Muslim community.\nIf clients have the option to do it in a Shariah-compliant manner, they want it,, say Maryam Khan. Shariah combines legal principles derived from the Quran, the teachings of Muhammad and interpretations of those teachings by Islamic jurisprudential scholars. It s perhaps most recognizable as a factor in financial transactions because Islam prohibits charging interest, but the Amal women apply Shariah more often in family law situations, like drafting estate planning documents recognized under Islamic and Illinois law.\nSharing a religious connection not only brings in this business but eases workplace pressures. Majdel Musa points out that they can maintain their cultural identity without worrying about drinking alcohol at social events or dressing a certain way. Indeed, four of the six wear traditional Muslim headscarves.\nAnd they are striving to break down another workplace barrier: creating a flexible, family-friendly environment. Children are welcome and can often be found in the office (five of the six lawyers are mothers). All six are free to maintain their own hours and work where they are most effective, be it telecommuting at midnight or working 9 to 5.\nWe feel no pressure to conform to anyone s ideal of a lawyer,, Musa says.\nExcept, of course, their own.\nComments\n1 .

I can learn so much from you six wonderful role models for muslim young women thinking about a profession in the law\nMuslim Women s Firm Serves Needs of Variety of Clients\nBy Stephen Anderson\nDomiciled on the third floor in the middle building of a Palos Heights office center is a small law firm that is as typical in many respects as it is unique in others.\nThe six partners in the Amal Law Group represent clients in matters that range from commercial and residential real estate, family law and estate planning, to immigration, criminal defense and civil rights. Something for almost anybody in need of legal counsel.\nLocated on Route 83, which is called College Drive in this area, the firm is based in Cook County s 5th Municipal District, but its partners travel frequently to downtown Chicago, Wheaton and other suburban courthouses.\nNothing unique about those attributes, but other things stand out among the practitioners in this neatly appointed law office.\nThe Amal Law Group is less than a year old, and the six partners have practiced law for only one to four years each. And all are women, Muslim women to be specific. Four are graduates of the DePaul University College of Law: Rima Najjar Kaplan, 05, Heena Musabji, 05, S. Janaan Hashim, 05, and Nikia Marie Bilal, 07.\nThe others are Majdel Sami Musa, Thomas M. Cooley Law School, 04, and Maryam Khan, Northern Illinois University College of Law, 05.\nTheir previous experience has been varied. Bilal clerked with the Cook County public guardian s office. Hashim was with the state appellate defender s office. Khan worked at Chicago Title and managed the real estate practice at Leeders & Associates.\nKapitan had a solo practice and has been staff attorney for the Council on American Islamic Relations. Musabji also was a staff attorney for CAIR-Chicago, where she directed the Citizenship Delay Program. Musa is a Realtor who had her own law firm.\nAlthough all were born in the United States, some are fluent in other languages. Kapitan and Musa, for instance, speak Arabic and French. Musabji can converse with clients in Gujrati, Hindi or Urdu.\nManaging niches of a general practice firm, the six partners provide comprehensive legal services to individuals and families outside of the Muslim community in the south suburbs. The firm name, Amal, translates to, hope, in Arabic, Hashim said., Our faith calls us to be active participants in civic life.\nAn adjunct professor at the McCormick Theological Seminary, where she teaches Religious Pluralism and the Ministry, Hashim is a spokesperson for the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago.\nThis firm is how we, a new generation of American Muslim women, choose to contribute,, she said,, offering our expertise and our service to communities in Chicago and beyond.\nMuslim Moms Join Forces, Open Law Firm\nOctober 5, 2007\nBy Shenequa A. Golding, Staff writer\nWhen asked what kind of attorney she is, Janaan Hashim has a sharp reply.\nA good one,, Hashim said with a laugh.\nShe is one of six attorneys in a new, all-female, all-Muslim, all-working-mother law firm in Palos Heights. The women named their venture Amal Law Group.\nAmal,, which is Arabic for, hope,, is what these attorneys hope to bring to their clients. Ranging in age from 27 to 40, the women practice a variety of specialties. Their law firm will offer general litigation, family law, immigration and civil rights law and more.\nFamily law and real estate attorney Maryam Khan said the firm's makeup will seem a little unusual to some clients.\nI think we're breaking quite a few stereotypes,, Khan said.\nDespite the characteristics they share as Muslim American women, the lawyers have many differences - beginning with appearance.\nRima Kapitan, an employment and estate planning attorney, and Majdel Musa, a business and real estate lawyer, do not wear the traditional hijab that adorns the heads of some Muslim women. They also don't look like what many might expect.\nKapitan - who has short, strawberry-blond hair and freckles -is a bi-racial Palestinian-American. Musa, who has a Belgian mother and Palestinian father, also doesn't have what many might consider typical features. Musa believes that's why she hasn't experienced much prejudice.\nI haven't experienced a lot of discrimination because I don't necessarily look Arab,, Musa said.\nHashim said she has been pleasantly surprised to find many people have a positive reaction to her as a Muslim attorney.\nNikia Bilal, who practices general litigation and family law, said not every experience is negative and, at times, individuals try to overcompensate.\nThere is that instantaneous 'who are you, and what's your purpose here ', Bilal said., (Sometimes) people try to prove how open-minded they are.\nHeena Musabji, who practices immigration law, hasn't encountered much discrimination because of her faith. More often, Musabji said, it's because of her gender.\nAt her former job, she said, clients expected her to work twice as hard as male counterparts to prove herself - particularly with male clients.\nMany reacted as if they were thinking,, Oh, you're the women taking my case,, Musabji said.\nKhan, who wears a hijab, said some clients judge her based on appearance.\nThe only difference between me and the next attorney is the cloth on my head,, she said., Which makes everyone else think that my IQ is lower, which it is not.\nBilal, Kapitan Hashim and Musabji all earned their law degrees from DePaul University, where Bilal attended school on a full scholarship and Hashim graduated cum laude.\nKhan graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University College of Law, and Musa earned her law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\nNot all the women originally planned on legal careers. Musa's parents told her she should be a lawyer, and Musabji originally wanted to be a dentist but had a change of heart when she realized she needed something she considered a higher purpose.\nBilal set her sights a little bigger.\nI wanted to be the Muslim equivalent of Oprah,, Bilal said.\nHashim said it was her husband's idea she go into law. He supported her and took care of their kids in the evenings while she went to law school.\nAlong with being attorneys, the six women have another full-time role as moms. Khan and Musabji both are mothers of two, Hashim and Bilal have three children each. The youngsters often are in the law firm offices, where their mothers juggle work with caring for them.\nSo do these women who chose careers in the legal profession watch any of the dozens of legal television shows\nMusa use to watch, Boston Legal., Bilal loved, Alley McBeal,, and Khan enjoyed, The Practice., But Hashim said she doesn't care for television shows based on her line of work because she believes they minimize serious issues.\nShe recalled the graphic crime scene photos from a case in which she represented a man appealing his first-degree murder conviction.\nThe victim's hands and feet had been tied, and the murderer had beaten and tried to drown him. Eventually, the killer used a razor to slit the victim's throat and shot him in the neck. It wasn't material for prime-time entertainment, she said.\nIts hard to look at this kind of entertainment, but this is real, and they're making money off it., Hashim said., To me, it doesn't sit right that we make this entertainment.\nThese women take on different types of cases and have different personalities, but they share a passion for the law and a faith in the American judicial system.\nBetter for 10 guilty men to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted,, Hashim said.\nAmal 's Angels\nAmal Law Group's lawyers enjoy working together and, when given the chance, are happy to describe one another.\nMaryam Khan: According to her partners, Khan is feisty. And when she wants to have fun, she does everything everyone else does,, minus the drinking.\nRima Kapitan: She plays the piano and the viola and, her peers, said, stands her ground.\nMajdel Musa: She is never too serious and is the self-proclaimed, mellow one., She enjoys photography.\nHeena Musabji: The other attorneys refer to Musabji as the, negotiator,, does yoga and travels. She also loves to salsa dance.\nJanaan Hashim: She likes to read and garden and is content with taking walks with her husband. The other lawyers said Hashim's the one with all the jokes.\nNikia Bilal: This lawyer enjoys traveling and has gone to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. She soon will be traveling to Asia. Bilal's the orderly one who has to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.\nUS Muslim Women Attorneys\nAugust 1, 2008\nCAIRO, Coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a group of American Muslim women are forming the country s first only-women law firm to dispel stereotypes about Muslim women.\nThey are defeating stereotypes on multiple levels,, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), told the Chicago Tribune on Friday, August 1., On the one hand you have Muslims standing up for justice and due process, and on the other hand you also see Muslim women succeeding in the professional world, leading the community in more ways than one.\nSix Muslim women attorneys formed Amal Law Group to offer legal help to American Muslims and clear misconceptions about Muslim women.\nPeople think that somehow we re weak and not able to express opinions,, Iraqi-born Janaan Hashim, 41, who founded the firm, said. Opened last year, the firm offers legal services on issues from civil rights and employment regulations to criminal, family, real estate and Immigration law.\nThe firm also organizes seminars for Muslims on drafting prenuptial agreements and helps teens avoid traffic tickets.\nPeople think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society,, said Maryam Khan, 28.\nOpen-minded\nThe six Muslim women are coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some don hijab while others don t. Some are Sunnis and others are Shiites., We never talk about it,, Hashim said., We are all open-minded and respect each other s beliefs.\nThe Muslim women were spurred to become lawyers to defend their community against backlashes following the 9 11 attacks., I think it s good for the community to have the opportunity to be represented by Muslims and hopefully the community will also feel empowered that six Muslim women attorneys are representing them,, said Kapitan.\nNearly seven years after the 9 11 attacks, many American Muslims complain that they continue to face discrimination and stereotyping because of their Islamic attires or identities.\nSince 2005 alone, CAIR-Chicago has logged more than 1,200 cases of Muslims reporting discrimination. Now, the Muslim women attorneys hope that their move would help show that Muslims are part and parcel of American society., We re part of the American fabric,, said Hashim.\nThere are between six to seven million Muslims in the United States, making up less than three percent of the country s 300 million population., You may not be used to seeing it, but this is what Muslim women in America look like,, said Khan., We re educated and we re professionals, and we re not an anomaly.\nCopyright, 2008 Islam Online","annotation":[{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":23333,"end":23345,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":23150,"end":23163,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":22093,"end":22105,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":21514,"end":21527,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":17044,"end":17057,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16834,"end":16846,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":15164,"end":15180,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":15141,"end":15153,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14874,"end":14887,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14285,"end":14298,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":12465,"end":12478,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":10467,"end":10480,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":10285,"end":10297,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9692,"end":9710,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9430,"end":9440,"text":"17083613600"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9338,"end":9356,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9338,"end":9351,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":8489,"end":8507,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8435,"end":8451,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":8311,"end":8328,"text":"General Litigation"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":8287,"end":8290,"text":"Esq."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8268,"end":8284,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7960,"end":7970,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7056,"end":7066,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6246,"end":6264,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":6195,"end":6205,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6077,"end":6088,"text":"Business Law"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6064,"end":6075,"text":"Contract Law"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6048,"end":6062,"text":"Estate Planning"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5998,"end":6001,"text":"Esq."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5985,"end":5995,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":3576,"end":3594,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3437,"end":3449,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":3323,"end":3330,"text":"Mediator"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":3269,"end":3290,"text":"Post-Conviction Relief"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3236,"end":3248,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":551,"end":565,"text":"Syeda M.

The six are American women of the Muslim faith, and they have started what they believe is a first-of-its-kind law firm. They hope to change the way others think about their religion and culture, as well as the way law can be practiced.\nThe pictures you see in the media of Muslim wom en are of very shrouded, very oppressed women,, says Janaan Hashim., That is not us, not what our faith advocates. We have a great opportunity to overcome the odds in a very pluralistic, very accepting society.\nLaunched last fall, the Amal Law Group in Palos Heights, Ill., is named after the Arabic word for hope, the partners say. The firm represents their hope for themselves and their community., Today the word Muslim has a very negative conno tation, and we are trying to overcome that,, Hashim says.\nMuch like the varied ethnicities of Amal s partners, a variety of matters are handled by the firm, including criminal defense and business law. While they don t exclusively cater to Muslims, the partners say their combined knowledge of American jurisprudence and Islamic law and culture has created a demand for their services in their growing Muslim community.\nIf clients have the option to do it in a Shariah-compliant manner, they want it,, say Maryam Khan. Shariah combines legal principles derived from the Quran, the teachings of Muhammad and interpretations of those teachings by Islamic jurisprudential scholars. It s perhaps most recognizable as a factor in financial transactions because Islam prohibits charging interest, but the Amal women apply Shariah more often in family law situations, like drafting estate planning documents recognized under Islamic and Illinois law.\nSharing a religious connection not only brings in this business but eases workplace pressures. Majdel Musa points out that they can maintain their cultural identity without worrying about drinking alcohol at social events or dressing a certain way. Indeed, four of the six wear traditional Muslim headscarves.\nAnd they are striving to break down another workplace barrier: creating a flexible, family-friendly environment. Children are welcome and can often be found in the office (five of the six lawyers are mothers). All six are free to maintain their own hours and work where they are most effective, be it telecommuting at midnight or working 9 to 5.\nWe feel no pressure to conform to anyone s ideal of a lawyer,, Musa says.\nExcept, of course, their own.\nComments\n1 .

I can learn so much from you six wonderful role models for muslim young women thinking about a profession in the law\nMuslim Women s Firm Serves Needs of Variety of Clients\nBy Stephen Anderson\nDomiciled on the third floor in the middle building of a Palos Heights office center is a small law firm that is as typical in many respects as it is unique in others.\nThe six partners in the Amal Law Group represent clients in matters that range from commercial and residential real estate, family law and estate planning, to immigration, criminal defense and civil rights. Something for almost anybody in need of legal counsel.\nLocated on Route 83, which is called College Drive in this area, the firm is based in Cook County s 5th Municipal District, but its partners travel frequently to downtown Chicago, Wheaton and other suburban courthouses.\nNothing unique about those attributes, but other things stand out among the practitioners in this neatly appointed law office.\nThe Amal Law Group is less than a year old, and the six partners have practiced law for only one to four years each. And all are women, Muslim women to be specific. Four are graduates of the DePaul University College of Law: Rima Najjar Kaplan, 05, Heena Musabji, 05, S. Janaan Hashim, 05, and Nikia Marie Bilal, 07.\nThe others are Majdel Sami Musa, Thomas M. Cooley Law School, 04, and Maryam Khan, Northern Illinois University College of Law, 05.\nTheir previous experience has been varied. Bilal clerked with the Cook County public guardian s office. Hashim was with the state appellate defender s office. Khan worked at Chicago Title and managed the real estate practice at Leeders & Associates.\nKapitan had a solo practice and has been staff attorney for the Council on American Islamic Relations. Musabji also was a staff attorney for CAIR-Chicago, where she directed the Citizenship Delay Program. Musa is a Realtor who had her own law firm.\nAlthough all were born in the United States, some are fluent in other languages. Kapitan and Musa, for instance, speak Arabic and French. Musabji can converse with clients in Gujrati, Hindi or Urdu.\nManaging niches of a general practice firm, the six partners provide comprehensive legal services to individuals and families outside of the Muslim community in the south suburbs. The firm name, Amal, translates to, hope, in Arabic, Hashim said., Our faith calls us to be active participants in civic life.\nAn adjunct professor at the McCormick Theological Seminary, where she teaches Religious Pluralism and the Ministry, Hashim is a spokesperson for the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago.\nThis firm is how we, a new generation of American Muslim women, choose to contribute,, she said,, offering our expertise and our service to communities in Chicago and beyond.\nMuslim Moms Join Forces, Open Law Firm\nOctober 5, 2007\nBy Shenequa A. Golding, Staff writer\nWhen asked what kind of attorney she is, Janaan Hashim has a sharp reply.\nA good one,, Hashim said with a laugh.\nShe is one of six attorneys in a new, all-female, all-Muslim, all-working-mother law firm in Palos Heights. The women named their venture Amal Law Group.\nAmal,, which is Arabic for, hope,, is what these attorneys hope to bring to their clients. Ranging in age from 27 to 40, the women practice a variety of specialties. Their law firm will offer general litigation, family law, immigration and civil rights law and more.\nFamily law and real estate attorney Maryam Khan said the firm's makeup will seem a little unusual to some clients.\nI think we're breaking quite a few stereotypes,, Khan said.\nDespite the characteristics they share as Muslim American women, the lawyers have many differences - beginning with appearance.\nRima Kapitan, an employment and estate planning attorney, and Majdel Musa, a business and real estate lawyer, do not wear the traditional hijab that adorns the heads of some Muslim women. They also don't look like what many might expect.\nKapitan - who has short, strawberry-blond hair and freckles -is a bi-racial Palestinian-American. Musa, who has a Belgian mother and Palestinian father, also doesn't have what many might consider typical features. Musa believes that's why she hasn't experienced much prejudice.\nI haven't experienced a lot of discrimination because I don't necessarily look Arab,, Musa said.\nHashim said she has been pleasantly surprised to find many people have a positive reaction to her as a Muslim attorney.\nNikia Bilal, who practices general litigation and family law, said not every experience is negative and, at times, individuals try to overcompensate.\nThere is that instantaneous 'who are you, and what's your purpose here ', Bilal said., (Sometimes) people try to prove how open-minded they are.\nHeena Musabji, who practices immigration law, hasn't encountered much discrimination because of her faith. More often, Musabji said, it's because of her gender.\nAt her former job, she said, clients expected her to work twice as hard as male counterparts to prove herself - particularly with male clients.\nMany reacted as if they were thinking,, Oh, you're the women taking my case,, Musabji said.\nKhan, who wears a hijab, said some clients judge her based on appearance.\nThe only difference between me and the next attorney is the cloth on my head,, she said., Which makes everyone else think that my IQ is lower, which it is not.\nBilal, Kapitan Hashim and Musabji all earned their law degrees from DePaul University, where Bilal attended school on a full scholarship and Hashim graduated cum laude.\nKhan graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University College of Law, and Musa earned her law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\nNot all the women originally planned on legal careers. Musa's parents told her she should be a lawyer, and Musabji originally wanted to be a dentist but had a change of heart when she realized she needed something she considered a higher purpose.\nBilal set her sights a little bigger.\nI wanted to be the Muslim equivalent of Oprah,, Bilal said.\nHashim said it was her husband's idea she go into law. He supported her and took care of their kids in the evenings while she went to law school.\nAlong with being attorneys, the six women have another full-time role as moms. Khan and Musabji both are mothers of two, Hashim and Bilal have three children each. The youngsters often are in the law firm offices, where their mothers juggle work with caring for them.\nSo do these women who chose careers in the legal profession watch any of the dozens of legal television shows\nMusa use to watch, Boston Legal., Bilal loved, Alley McBeal,, and Khan enjoyed, The Practice., But Hashim said she doesn't care for television shows based on her line of work because she believes they minimize serious issues.\nShe recalled the graphic crime scene photos from a case in which she represented a man appealing his first-degree murder conviction.\nThe victim's hands and feet had been tied, and the murderer had beaten and tried to drown him. Eventually, the killer used a razor to slit the victim's throat and shot him in the neck. It wasn't material for prime-time entertainment, she said.\nIts hard to look at this kind of entertainment, but this is real, and they're making money off it., Hashim said., To me, it doesn't sit right that we make this entertainment.\nThese women take on different types of cases and have different personalities, but they share a passion for the law and a faith in the American judicial system.\nBetter for 10 guilty men to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted,, Hashim said.\nAmal 's Angels\nAmal Law Group's lawyers enjoy working together and, when given the chance, are happy to describe one another.\nMaryam Khan: According to her partners, Khan is feisty. And when she wants to have fun, she does everything everyone else does,, minus the drinking.\nRima Kapitan: She plays the piano and the viola and, her peers, said, stands her ground.\nMajdel Musa: She is never too serious and is the self-proclaimed, mellow one., She enjoys photography.\nHeena Musabji: The other attorneys refer to Musabji as the, negotiator,, does yoga and travels. She also loves to salsa dance.\nJanaan Hashim: She likes to read and garden and is content with taking walks with her husband. The other lawyers said Hashim's the one with all the jokes.\nNikia Bilal: This lawyer enjoys traveling and has gone to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. She soon will be traveling to Asia. Bilal's the orderly one who has to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.\nUS Muslim Women Attorneys\nAugust 1, 2008\nCAIRO, Coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a group of American Muslim women are forming the country s first only-women law firm to dispel stereotypes about Muslim women.\nThey are defeating stereotypes on multiple levels,, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), told the Chicago Tribune on Friday, August 1., On the one hand you have Muslims standing up for justice and due process, and on the other hand you also see Muslim women succeeding in the professional world, leading the community in more ways than one.\nSix Muslim women attorneys formed Amal Law Group to offer legal help to American Muslims and clear misconceptions about Muslim women.\nPeople think that somehow we re weak and not able to express opinions,, Iraqi-born Janaan Hashim, 41, who founded the firm, said. Opened last year, the firm offers legal services on issues from civil rights and employment regulations to criminal, family, real estate and Immigration law.\nThe firm also organizes seminars for Muslims on drafting prenuptial agreements and helps teens avoid traffic tickets.\nPeople think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society,, said Maryam Khan, 28.\nOpen-minded\nThe six Muslim women are coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some don hijab while others don t. Some are Sunnis and others are Shiites., We never talk about it,, Hashim said., We are all open-minded and respect each other s beliefs.\nThe Muslim women were spurred to become lawyers to defend their community against backlashes following the 9 11 attacks., I think it s good for the community to have the opportunity to be represented by Muslims and hopefully the community will also feel empowered that six Muslim women attorneys are representing them,, said Kapitan.\nNearly seven years after the 9 11 attacks, many American Muslims complain that they continue to face discrimination and stereotyping because of their Islamic attires or identities.\nSince 2005 alone, CAIR-Chicago has logged more than 1,200 cases of Muslims reporting discrimination. Now, the Muslim women attorneys hope that their move would help show that Muslims are part and parcel of American society., We re part of the American fabric,, said Hashim.\nThere are between six to seven million Muslims in the United States, making up less than three percent of the country s 300 million population., You may not be used to seeing it, but this is what Muslim women in America look like,, said Khan., We re educated and we re professionals, and we re not an anomaly.\nCopyright, 2008 Islam Online","annotation":[{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":18396,"end":18406,"text":"Maryam Khan"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":18163,"end":18173,"text":"Immigration"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":17975,"end":17987,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":17792,"end":17805,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16890,"end":16900,"text":"Nikia Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16735,"end":16747,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16608,"end":16620,"text":"Heena Musabji"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16505,"end":16515,"text":"Majdel Musa"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16416,"end":16427,"text":"Rima Kapitan"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16267,"end":16277,"text":"Maryam Khan"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":16156,"end":16169,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14211,"end":14237,"text":"Thomas M.

Attorney Simmons is admitted to practice in New Hampshire and to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.\nAttorney Simmons says,, I believe knowing about my clients as people first helps me to understand how to give them advice. You will find me asking questions that probe further as to why you are asking for help. Once I have a firm handle on what you believe your needs are, I can then fill in the entire picture by explaining the legal landscape for you.\nAttorney Simmons is a staunch defender of parental rights. John Anthony is an Allied Attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom, formerly the Alliance Defense Fund.

Ortlieb, Esquire\nPartner\nI began the practice of law in New Hampshire after having graduated cum laude from Suffolk University Law School in 2006. While in law school I received several academic awards, including the Distinguished Oral Advocate Award. While in school, I worked full-time as a paralegal for Burns, Bryant, Cox, Rockefeller & Durkin, one of New Hampshire s oldest law firms.\nAfter receiving my juris doctor, I worked as a contract attorney in Boston before joining John Anthony Simmons, PLLC in 2008. I became a partner in the firm in 2012.\nThe breadth of my legal experience has given me valuable insight into all aspects of client representation and efficient law firm operations.\nI pride myself on speaking plainly with my clients, explaining the legal issues facing them in English, not legalese, so they can understand their choices and make informed decisions, including them in every step along the way. I provide my clients with an honest analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their case, even when it is difficult for them to hear. I make myself available to my clients as much as possible.\nI am persistent and fight zealously for my clients, particularly those who have been wronged by big business or chewed up by the system. As a litigator, I enjoy passionately advocating for my clients, rights, whether to a judge, jury or administrative panel. While litigation is sometimes necessary, I also know when mediation or arbitration is the correct path to victory for my clients.\nMy core practice areas include, civil litigation (including, personal injury),, family law (divorce, child support and alimony, custody and parental rights cases, adoption, guardianships), landlord-tenant, estate planning (Wills, Trusts, Powers of Attorney), criminal record annulments (clears criminal record).\nI am admitted to practice in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, including the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. I am a member of the New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bar Associations. In 2013, I was chosen to participate in the New Hampshire Bar Leadership Academy, a select group chosen by the Bar to promote and encourage leadership and professionalism by identifying present and future leaders of the New Hampshire Bar. Prior to attending law school, I received a B.A. in Psychology and a B.A in Behavioral Science, both with High Honors from Cedarville University in 1992, and was included in the 1992 Who s Who in American Colleges and Universities.\nI grew up outside of Milwaukee and have been a New Hampshire resident since 1993. I currently live in Dover with my wife, five children and Bernese Mountain Dog.\nAt Simmons & Ortlieb, P.L.L.C., we seek to build long-term relationships with our clients and we help our clients with a broad range of their legal needs.\nExplore\nHome\nAbout Us\nServices\nClient Testimonials\nContact Us\nBusiness Law\nCivil Litigation\nCriminal Litigation\nEstate Planning\nLand Use\nPersonal Injury\nFacebook\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\n2017 Simmons & Ortlieb PLLC.\nLaw office website design by High Effect Design NH\nTop","annotation":[{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6998,"end":7019,"text":"Simmons & Ortlieb PLLC"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6942,"end":6956,"text":"Personal Injury"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6933,"end":6940,"text":"Land Use"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6917,"end":6931,"text":"Estate Planning"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6897,"end":6904,"text":"Criminal"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6880,"end":6895,"text":"Civil Litigation"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6867,"end":6878,"text":"Business Law"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6653,"end":6679,"text":"Simmons & Ortlieb, P.L.L.C."}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":4464,"end":4489,"text":"John Anthony Simmons, PLLC"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3993,"end":3999,"text":"Esquire"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3973,"end":3990,"text":"Michael J.

I defended insurance companies in lawsuits brought by their policyholders. This work gave me insightful knowledge, but I was very unhappy and unfulfilled. After years of what I felt was the wrong side of justice, I left big corporate law firm life to help people on the other side -- to make a difference in the lives of those who most need skilled legal support.\nI m happiest when I m fighting for justice against big firms that think they re untouchable. When people are at the lowest points in their lives, injured, depressed, and worried about their futures, I step in to make a difference in their lives. I m there to help take away their fears, loneliness and pain, to let them know they re no longer in this fight alone. I love being a trial lawyer. I am devoted to becoming the best person and lawyer that I can be. That s why I fight for justice with all of my heart and soul, and stay fully committed to my clients.\nMy firm takes a limited number of cases, so I can personally devote a tremendous amount of time and care to each client. I get to know my clients and their families very well. I can only help my clients if I truly know them and understand them. That s why I spend a lot of time visiting my clients at their homes and elsewhere. I take every case very seriously, because the outcome of each case can affect the lives of thousands of families across America. I don t settle clients, cases quickly and cheaply to earn easy money. Every member of my firm works hard to do everything possible to obtain all of the justice the law allows for each client.\nMy team and I thank you for visiting our site and we encourage you to call us with any questions for a free consultation at (626) 243-5598 or, send us an inquiry form online.\nFree Consultation, (626) 243-5598, 6262435598)\nN a\nLaw Offices of Scott Glovsky\nClaremont Office\n343 Harvard Avenue\nClaremont, CA 91711\nGet Directions\nTel:, (626) 243-5598, 6262435598, Phone )\nPasadena Office\n100 East Corson Street,\nSuite 200\nPasadena, CA 91103\nGet Directions\n(By Appointment Only)\nMore Information\nHome\nHealth Insurance Denial\nBad Faith Insurance\nMedical Necessity Denials\nResources\nLos Angeles Insurance Law Explained\nPasadena Personal Injury Law Explained\nLos Angeles ERISA Lawyer\nPersonal Injury Law Trial\nCopyright (C) Scott Glovsky 2019.

The six are American women of the Muslim faith, and they have started what they believe is a first-of-its-kind law firm. They hope to change the way others think about their religion and culture, as well as the way law can be practiced.\nThe pictures you see in the media of Muslim wom en are of very shrouded, very oppressed women,, says Janaan Hashim., That is not us, not what our faith advocates. We have a great opportunity to overcome the odds in a very pluralistic, very accepting society.\nLaunched last fall, the Amal Law Group in Palos Heights, Ill., is named after the Arabic word for hope, the partners say. The firm represents their hope for themselves and their community., Today the word Muslim has a very negative conno tation, and we are trying to overcome that,, Hashim says.\nMuch like the varied ethnicities of Amal s partners, a variety of matters are handled by the firm, including criminal defense and business law. While they don t exclusively cater to Muslims, the partners say their combined knowledge of American jurisprudence and Islamic law and culture has created a demand for their services in their growing Muslim community.\nIf clients have the option to do it in a Shariah-compliant manner, they want it,, say Maryam Khan. Shariah combines legal principles derived from the Quran, the teachings of Muhammad and interpretations of those teachings by Islamic jurisprudential scholars. It s perhaps most recognizable as a factor in financial transactions because Islam prohibits charging interest, but the Amal women apply Shariah more often in family law situations, like drafting estate planning documents recognized under Islamic and Illinois law.\nSharing a religious connection not only brings in this business but eases workplace pressures. Majdel Musa points out that they can maintain their cultural identity without worrying about drinking alcohol at social events or dressing a certain way. Indeed, four of the six wear traditional Muslim headscarves.\nAnd they are striving to break down another workplace barrier: creating a flexible, family-friendly environment. Children are welcome and can often be found in the office (five of the six lawyers are mothers). All six are free to maintain their own hours and work where they are most effective, be it telecommuting at midnight or working 9 to 5.\nWe feel no pressure to conform to anyone s ideal of a lawyer,, Musa says.\nExcept, of course, their own.\nComments\n1 .

I can learn so much from you six wonderful role models for muslim young women thinking about a profession in the law\nMuslim Women s Firm Serves Needs of Variety of Clients\nBy Stephen Anderson\nDomiciled on the third floor in the middle building of a Palos Heights office center is a small law firm that is as typical in many respects as it is unique in others.\nThe six partners in the Amal Law Group represent clients in matters that range from commercial and residential real estate, family law and estate planning, to immigration, criminal defense and civil rights. Something for almost anybody in need of legal counsel.\nLocated on Route 83, which is called College Drive in this area, the firm is based in Cook County s 5th Municipal District, but its partners travel frequently to downtown Chicago, Wheaton and other suburban courthouses.\nNothing unique about those attributes, but other things stand out among the practitioners in this neatly appointed law office.\nThe Amal Law Group is less than a year old, and the six partners have practiced law for only one to four years each. And all are women, Muslim women to be specific. Four are graduates of the DePaul University College of Law: Rima Najjar Kaplan, 05, Heena Musabji, 05, S. Janaan Hashim, 05, and Nikia Marie Bilal, 07.\nThe others are Majdel Sami Musa, Thomas M. Cooley Law School, 04, and Maryam Khan, Northern Illinois University College of Law, 05.\nTheir previous experience has been varied. Bilal clerked with the Cook County public guardian s office. Hashim was with the state appellate defender s office. Khan worked at Chicago Title and managed the real estate practice at Leeders & Associates.\nKapitan had a solo practice and has been staff attorney for the Council on American Islamic Relations. Musabji also was a staff attorney for CAIR-Chicago, where she directed the Citizenship Delay Program. Musa is a Realtor who had her own law firm.\nAlthough all were born in the United States, some are fluent in other languages. Kapitan and Musa, for instance, speak Arabic and French. Musabji can converse with clients in Gujrati, Hindi or Urdu.\nManaging niches of a general practice firm, the six partners provide comprehensive legal services to individuals and families outside of the Muslim community in the south suburbs. The firm name, Amal, translates to, hope, in Arabic, Hashim said., Our faith calls us to be active participants in civic life.\nAn adjunct professor at the McCormick Theological Seminary, where she teaches Religious Pluralism and the Ministry, Hashim is a spokesperson for the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago.\nThis firm is how we, a new generation of American Muslim women, choose to contribute,, she said,, offering our expertise and our service to communities in Chicago and beyond.\nMuslim Moms Join Forces, Open Law Firm\nOctober 5, 2007\nBy Shenequa A. Golding, Staff writer\nWhen asked what kind of attorney she is, Janaan Hashim has a sharp reply.\nA good one,, Hashim said with a laugh.\nShe is one of six attorneys in a new, all-female, all-Muslim, all-working-mother law firm in Palos Heights. The women named their venture Amal Law Group.\nAmal,, which is Arabic for, hope,, is what these attorneys hope to bring to their clients. Ranging in age from 27 to 40, the women practice a variety of specialties. Their law firm will offer general litigation, family law, immigration and civil rights law and more.\nFamily law and real estate attorney Maryam Khan said the firm's makeup will seem a little unusual to some clients.\nI think we're breaking quite a few stereotypes,, Khan said.\nDespite the characteristics they share as Muslim American women, the lawyers have many differences - beginning with appearance.\nRima Kapitan, an employment and estate planning attorney, and Majdel Musa, a business and real estate lawyer, do not wear the traditional hijab that adorns the heads of some Muslim women. They also don't look like what many might expect.\nKapitan - who has short, strawberry-blond hair and freckles -is a bi-racial Palestinian-American. Musa, who has a Belgian mother and Palestinian father, also doesn't have what many might consider typical features. Musa believes that's why she hasn't experienced much prejudice.\nI haven't experienced a lot of discrimination because I don't necessarily look Arab,, Musa said.\nHashim said she has been pleasantly surprised to find many people have a positive reaction to her as a Muslim attorney.\nNikia Bilal, who practices general litigation and family law, said not every experience is negative and, at times, individuals try to overcompensate.\nThere is that instantaneous 'who are you, and what's your purpose here ', Bilal said., (Sometimes) people try to prove how open-minded they are.\nHeena Musabji, who practices immigration law, hasn't encountered much discrimination because of her faith. More often, Musabji said, it's because of her gender.\nAt her former job, she said, clients expected her to work twice as hard as male counterparts to prove herself - particularly with male clients.\nMany reacted as if they were thinking,, Oh, you're the women taking my case,, Musabji said.\nKhan, who wears a hijab, said some clients judge her based on appearance.\nThe only difference between me and the next attorney is the cloth on my head,, she said., Which makes everyone else think that my IQ is lower, which it is not.\nBilal, Kapitan Hashim and Musabji all earned their law degrees from DePaul University, where Bilal attended school on a full scholarship and Hashim graduated cum laude.\nKhan graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University College of Law, and Musa earned her law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\nNot all the women originally planned on legal careers. Musa's parents told her she should be a lawyer, and Musabji originally wanted to be a dentist but had a change of heart when she realized she needed something she considered a higher purpose.\nBilal set her sights a little bigger.\nI wanted to be the Muslim equivalent of Oprah,, Bilal said.\nHashim said it was her husband's idea she go into law. He supported her and took care of their kids in the evenings while she went to law school.\nAlong with being attorneys, the six women have another full-time role as moms. Khan and Musabji both are mothers of two, Hashim and Bilal have three children each. The youngsters often are in the law firm offices, where their mothers juggle work with caring for them.\nSo do these women who chose careers in the legal profession watch any of the dozens of legal television shows\nMusa use to watch, Boston Legal., Bilal loved, Alley McBeal,, and Khan enjoyed, The Practice., But Hashim said she doesn't care for television shows based on her line of work because she believes they minimize serious issues.\nShe recalled the graphic crime scene photos from a case in which she represented a man appealing his first-degree murder conviction.\nThe victim's hands and feet had been tied, and the murderer had beaten and tried to drown him. Eventually, the killer used a razor to slit the victim's throat and shot him in the neck. It wasn't material for prime-time entertainment, she said.\nIts hard to look at this kind of entertainment, but this is real, and they're making money off it., Hashim said., To me, it doesn't sit right that we make this entertainment.\nThese women take on different types of cases and have different personalities, but they share a passion for the law and a faith in the American judicial system.\nBetter for 10 guilty men to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted,, Hashim said.\nAmal 's Angels\nAmal Law Group's lawyers enjoy working together and, when given the chance, are happy to describe one another.\nMaryam Khan: According to her partners, Khan is feisty. And when she wants to have fun, she does everything everyone else does,, minus the drinking.\nRima Kapitan: She plays the piano and the viola and, her peers, said, stands her ground.\nMajdel Musa: She is never too serious and is the self-proclaimed, mellow one., She enjoys photography.\nHeena Musabji: The other attorneys refer to Musabji as the, negotiator,, does yoga and travels. She also loves to salsa dance.\nJanaan Hashim: She likes to read and garden and is content with taking walks with her husband. The other lawyers said Hashim's the one with all the jokes.\nNikia Bilal: This lawyer enjoys traveling and has gone to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. She soon will be traveling to Asia. Bilal's the orderly one who has to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.\nUS Muslim Women Attorneys\nAugust 1, 2008\nCAIRO, Coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a group of American Muslim women are forming the country s first only-women law firm to dispel stereotypes about Muslim women.\nThey are defeating stereotypes on multiple levels,, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), told the Chicago Tribune on Friday, August 1., On the one hand you have Muslims standing up for justice and due process, and on the other hand you also see Muslim women succeeding in the professional world, leading the community in more ways than one.\nSix Muslim women attorneys formed Amal Law Group to offer legal help to American Muslims and clear misconceptions about Muslim women.\nPeople think that somehow we re weak and not able to express opinions,, Iraqi-born Janaan Hashim, 41, who founded the firm, said. Opened last year, the firm offers legal services on issues from civil rights and employment regulations to criminal, family, real estate and Immigration law.\nThe firm also organizes seminars for Muslims on drafting prenuptial agreements and helps teens avoid traffic tickets.\nPeople think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society,, said Maryam Khan, 28.\nOpen-minded\nThe six Muslim women are coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some don hijab while others don t. Some are Sunnis and others are Shiites., We never talk about it,, Hashim said., We are all open-minded and respect each other s beliefs.\nThe Muslim women were spurred to become lawyers to defend their community against backlashes following the 9 11 attacks., I think it s good for the community to have the opportunity to be represented by Muslims and hopefully the community will also feel empowered that six Muslim women attorneys are representing them,, said Kapitan.\nNearly seven years after the 9 11 attacks, many American Muslims complain that they continue to face discrimination and stereotyping because of their Islamic attires or identities.\nSince 2005 alone, CAIR-Chicago has logged more than 1,200 cases of Muslims reporting discrimination. Now, the Muslim women attorneys hope that their move would help show that Muslims are part and parcel of American society., We re part of the American fabric,, said Hashim.\nThere are between six to seven million Muslims in the United States, making up less than three percent of the country s 300 million population., You may not be used to seeing it, but this is what Muslim women in America look like,, said Khan., We re educated and we re professionals, and we re not an anomaly.\nCopyright, 2008 Islam Online","annotation":[{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":23333,"end":23345,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":23150,"end":23163,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":22093,"end":22105,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":21514,"end":21527,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":17044,"end":17057,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16834,"end":16846,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":15164,"end":15180,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":15141,"end":15153,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14874,"end":14887,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14285,"end":14298,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":12465,"end":12478,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":10467,"end":10480,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":10285,"end":10297,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9692,"end":9710,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PHONE"],"points":[{"start":9430,"end":9440,"text":"17083613600"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9338,"end":9356,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":9338,"end":9351,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":8489,"end":8507,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8435,"end":8451,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":8311,"end":8328,"text":"General Litigation"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":8287,"end":8290,"text":"Esq."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":8268,"end":8284,"text":"Nikia Marie Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7960,"end":7970,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":7056,"end":7066,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6246,"end":6264,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":6195,"end":6205,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6077,"end":6088,"text":"Business Law"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6064,"end":6075,"text":"Contract Law"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6048,"end":6062,"text":"Estate Planning"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":5998,"end":6001,"text":"Esq."}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":5985,"end":5995,"text":"Farrah Qazi"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":3576,"end":3594,"text":"Amal Law Group, LLC"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3437,"end":3449,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":3323,"end":3330,"text":"Mediator"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":3269,"end":3290,"text":"Post-Conviction Relief"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3236,"end":3248,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":551,"end":565,"text":"Syeda M.

The six are American women of the Muslim faith, and they have started what they believe is a first-of-its-kind law firm. They hope to change the way others think about their religion and culture, as well as the way law can be practiced.\nThe pictures you see in the media of Muslim wom en are of very shrouded, very oppressed women,, says Janaan Hashim., That is not us, not what our faith advocates. We have a great opportunity to overcome the odds in a very pluralistic, very accepting society.\nLaunched last fall, the Amal Law Group in Palos Heights, Ill., is named after the Arabic word for hope, the partners say. The firm represents their hope for themselves and their community., Today the word Muslim has a very negative conno tation, and we are trying to overcome that,, Hashim says.\nMuch like the varied ethnicities of Amal s partners, a variety of matters are handled by the firm, including criminal defense and business law. While they don t exclusively cater to Muslims, the partners say their combined knowledge of American jurisprudence and Islamic law and culture has created a demand for their services in their growing Muslim community.\nIf clients have the option to do it in a Shariah-compliant manner, they want it,, say Maryam Khan. Shariah combines legal principles derived from the Quran, the teachings of Muhammad and interpretations of those teachings by Islamic jurisprudential scholars. It s perhaps most recognizable as a factor in financial transactions because Islam prohibits charging interest, but the Amal women apply Shariah more often in family law situations, like drafting estate planning documents recognized under Islamic and Illinois law.\nSharing a religious connection not only brings in this business but eases workplace pressures. Majdel Musa points out that they can maintain their cultural identity without worrying about drinking alcohol at social events or dressing a certain way. Indeed, four of the six wear traditional Muslim headscarves.\nAnd they are striving to break down another workplace barrier: creating a flexible, family-friendly environment. Children are welcome and can often be found in the office (five of the six lawyers are mothers). All six are free to maintain their own hours and work where they are most effective, be it telecommuting at midnight or working 9 to 5.\nWe feel no pressure to conform to anyone s ideal of a lawyer,, Musa says.\nExcept, of course, their own.\nComments\n1 .

I can learn so much from you six wonderful role models for muslim young women thinking about a profession in the law\nMuslim Women s Firm Serves Needs of Variety of Clients\nBy Stephen Anderson\nDomiciled on the third floor in the middle building of a Palos Heights office center is a small law firm that is as typical in many respects as it is unique in others.\nThe six partners in the Amal Law Group represent clients in matters that range from commercial and residential real estate, family law and estate planning, to immigration, criminal defense and civil rights. Something for almost anybody in need of legal counsel.\nLocated on Route 83, which is called College Drive in this area, the firm is based in Cook County s 5th Municipal District, but its partners travel frequently to downtown Chicago, Wheaton and other suburban courthouses.\nNothing unique about those attributes, but other things stand out among the practitioners in this neatly appointed law office.\nThe Amal Law Group is less than a year old, and the six partners have practiced law for only one to four years each. And all are women, Muslim women to be specific. Four are graduates of the DePaul University College of Law: Rima Najjar Kaplan, 05, Heena Musabji, 05, S. Janaan Hashim, 05, and Nikia Marie Bilal, 07.\nThe others are Majdel Sami Musa, Thomas M. Cooley Law School, 04, and Maryam Khan, Northern Illinois University College of Law, 05.\nTheir previous experience has been varied. Bilal clerked with the Cook County public guardian s office. Hashim was with the state appellate defender s office. Khan worked at Chicago Title and managed the real estate practice at Leeders & Associates.\nKapitan had a solo practice and has been staff attorney for the Council on American Islamic Relations. Musabji also was a staff attorney for CAIR-Chicago, where she directed the Citizenship Delay Program. Musa is a Realtor who had her own law firm.\nAlthough all were born in the United States, some are fluent in other languages. Kapitan and Musa, for instance, speak Arabic and French. Musabji can converse with clients in Gujrati, Hindi or Urdu.\nManaging niches of a general practice firm, the six partners provide comprehensive legal services to individuals and families outside of the Muslim community in the south suburbs. The firm name, Amal, translates to, hope, in Arabic, Hashim said., Our faith calls us to be active participants in civic life.\nAn adjunct professor at the McCormick Theological Seminary, where she teaches Religious Pluralism and the Ministry, Hashim is a spokesperson for the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago.\nThis firm is how we, a new generation of American Muslim women, choose to contribute,, she said,, offering our expertise and our service to communities in Chicago and beyond.\nMuslim Moms Join Forces, Open Law Firm\nOctober 5, 2007\nBy Shenequa A. Golding, Staff writer\nWhen asked what kind of attorney she is, Janaan Hashim has a sharp reply.\nA good one,, Hashim said with a laugh.\nShe is one of six attorneys in a new, all-female, all-Muslim, all-working-mother law firm in Palos Heights. The women named their venture Amal Law Group.\nAmal,, which is Arabic for, hope,, is what these attorneys hope to bring to their clients. Ranging in age from 27 to 40, the women practice a variety of specialties. Their law firm will offer general litigation, family law, immigration and civil rights law and more.\nFamily law and real estate attorney Maryam Khan said the firm's makeup will seem a little unusual to some clients.\nI think we're breaking quite a few stereotypes,, Khan said.\nDespite the characteristics they share as Muslim American women, the lawyers have many differences - beginning with appearance.\nRima Kapitan, an employment and estate planning attorney, and Majdel Musa, a business and real estate lawyer, do not wear the traditional hijab that adorns the heads of some Muslim women. They also don't look like what many might expect.\nKapitan - who has short, strawberry-blond hair and freckles -is a bi-racial Palestinian-American. Musa, who has a Belgian mother and Palestinian father, also doesn't have what many might consider typical features. Musa believes that's why she hasn't experienced much prejudice.\nI haven't experienced a lot of discrimination because I don't necessarily look Arab,, Musa said.\nHashim said she has been pleasantly surprised to find many people have a positive reaction to her as a Muslim attorney.\nNikia Bilal, who practices general litigation and family law, said not every experience is negative and, at times, individuals try to overcompensate.\nThere is that instantaneous 'who are you, and what's your purpose here ', Bilal said., (Sometimes) people try to prove how open-minded they are.\nHeena Musabji, who practices immigration law, hasn't encountered much discrimination because of her faith. More often, Musabji said, it's because of her gender.\nAt her former job, she said, clients expected her to work twice as hard as male counterparts to prove herself - particularly with male clients.\nMany reacted as if they were thinking,, Oh, you're the women taking my case,, Musabji said.\nKhan, who wears a hijab, said some clients judge her based on appearance.\nThe only difference between me and the next attorney is the cloth on my head,, she said., Which makes everyone else think that my IQ is lower, which it is not.\nBilal, Kapitan Hashim and Musabji all earned their law degrees from DePaul University, where Bilal attended school on a full scholarship and Hashim graduated cum laude.\nKhan graduated cum laude from Northern Illinois University College of Law, and Musa earned her law degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.\nNot all the women originally planned on legal careers. Musa's parents told her she should be a lawyer, and Musabji originally wanted to be a dentist but had a change of heart when she realized she needed something she considered a higher purpose.\nBilal set her sights a little bigger.\nI wanted to be the Muslim equivalent of Oprah,, Bilal said.\nHashim said it was her husband's idea she go into law. He supported her and took care of their kids in the evenings while she went to law school.\nAlong with being attorneys, the six women have another full-time role as moms. Khan and Musabji both are mothers of two, Hashim and Bilal have three children each. The youngsters often are in the law firm offices, where their mothers juggle work with caring for them.\nSo do these women who chose careers in the legal profession watch any of the dozens of legal television shows\nMusa use to watch, Boston Legal., Bilal loved, Alley McBeal,, and Khan enjoyed, The Practice., But Hashim said she doesn't care for television shows based on her line of work because she believes they minimize serious issues.\nShe recalled the graphic crime scene photos from a case in which she represented a man appealing his first-degree murder conviction.\nThe victim's hands and feet had been tied, and the murderer had beaten and tried to drown him. Eventually, the killer used a razor to slit the victim's throat and shot him in the neck. It wasn't material for prime-time entertainment, she said.\nIts hard to look at this kind of entertainment, but this is real, and they're making money off it., Hashim said., To me, it doesn't sit right that we make this entertainment.\nThese women take on different types of cases and have different personalities, but they share a passion for the law and a faith in the American judicial system.\nBetter for 10 guilty men to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted,, Hashim said.\nAmal 's Angels\nAmal Law Group's lawyers enjoy working together and, when given the chance, are happy to describe one another.\nMaryam Khan: According to her partners, Khan is feisty. And when she wants to have fun, she does everything everyone else does,, minus the drinking.\nRima Kapitan: She plays the piano and the viola and, her peers, said, stands her ground.\nMajdel Musa: She is never too serious and is the self-proclaimed, mellow one., She enjoys photography.\nHeena Musabji: The other attorneys refer to Musabji as the, negotiator,, does yoga and travels. She also loves to salsa dance.\nJanaan Hashim: She likes to read and garden and is content with taking walks with her husband. The other lawyers said Hashim's the one with all the jokes.\nNikia Bilal: This lawyer enjoys traveling and has gone to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. She soon will be traveling to Asia. Bilal's the orderly one who has to make sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's are dotted.\nUS Muslim Women Attorneys\nAugust 1, 2008\nCAIRO, Coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a group of American Muslim women are forming the country s first only-women law firm to dispel stereotypes about Muslim women.\nThey are defeating stereotypes on multiple levels,, Ahmed Rehab, executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), told the Chicago Tribune on Friday, August 1., On the one hand you have Muslims standing up for justice and due process, and on the other hand you also see Muslim women succeeding in the professional world, leading the community in more ways than one.\nSix Muslim women attorneys formed Amal Law Group to offer legal help to American Muslims and clear misconceptions about Muslim women.\nPeople think that somehow we re weak and not able to express opinions,, Iraqi-born Janaan Hashim, 41, who founded the firm, said. Opened last year, the firm offers legal services on issues from civil rights and employment regulations to criminal, family, real estate and Immigration law.\nThe firm also organizes seminars for Muslims on drafting prenuptial agreements and helps teens avoid traffic tickets.\nPeople think that we are prohibited from getting an education and being engaged in society,, said Maryam Khan, 28.\nOpen-minded\nThe six Muslim women are coming from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some don hijab while others don t. Some are Sunnis and others are Shiites., We never talk about it,, Hashim said., We are all open-minded and respect each other s beliefs.\nThe Muslim women were spurred to become lawyers to defend their community against backlashes following the 9 11 attacks., I think it s good for the community to have the opportunity to be represented by Muslims and hopefully the community will also feel empowered that six Muslim women attorneys are representing them,, said Kapitan.\nNearly seven years after the 9 11 attacks, many American Muslims complain that they continue to face discrimination and stereotyping because of their Islamic attires or identities.\nSince 2005 alone, CAIR-Chicago has logged more than 1,200 cases of Muslims reporting discrimination. Now, the Muslim women attorneys hope that their move would help show that Muslims are part and parcel of American society., We re part of the American fabric,, said Hashim.\nThere are between six to seven million Muslims in the United States, making up less than three percent of the country s 300 million population., You may not be used to seeing it, but this is what Muslim women in America look like,, said Khan., We re educated and we re professionals, and we re not an anomaly.\nCopyright, 2008 Islam Online","annotation":[{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":18396,"end":18406,"text":"Maryam Khan"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":18163,"end":18173,"text":"Immigration"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":17975,"end":17987,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":17792,"end":17805,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16890,"end":16900,"text":"Nikia Bilal"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16735,"end":16747,"text":"Janaan Hashim"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16608,"end":16620,"text":"Heena Musabji"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16505,"end":16515,"text":"Majdel Musa"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16416,"end":16427,"text":"Rima Kapitan"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":16267,"end":16277,"text":"Maryam Khan"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":16156,"end":16169,"text":"Amal Law Group"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":14211,"end":14237,"text":"Thomas M.

Attorney Simmons is admitted to practice in New Hampshire and to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire.\nAttorney Simmons says,, I believe knowing about my clients as people first helps me to understand how to give them advice. You will find me asking questions that probe further as to why you are asking for help. Once I have a firm handle on what you believe your needs are, I can then fill in the entire picture by explaining the legal landscape for you.\nAttorney Simmons is a staunch defender of parental rights. John Anthony is an Allied Attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom, formerly the Alliance Defense Fund.

Ortlieb, Esquire\nPartner\nI began the practice of law in New Hampshire after having graduated cum laude from Suffolk University Law School in 2006. While in law school I received several academic awards, including the Distinguished Oral Advocate Award. While in school, I worked full-time as a paralegal for Burns, Bryant, Cox, Rockefeller & Durkin, one of New Hampshire s oldest law firms.\nAfter receiving my juris doctor, I worked as a contract attorney in Boston before joining John Anthony Simmons, PLLC in 2008. I became a partner in the firm in 2012.\nThe breadth of my legal experience has given me valuable insight into all aspects of client representation and efficient law firm operations.\nI pride myself on speaking plainly with my clients, explaining the legal issues facing them in English, not legalese, so they can understand their choices and make informed decisions, including them in every step along the way. I provide my clients with an honest analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their case, even when it is difficult for them to hear. I make myself available to my clients as much as possible.\nI am persistent and fight zealously for my clients, particularly those who have been wronged by big business or chewed up by the system. As a litigator, I enjoy passionately advocating for my clients, rights, whether to a judge, jury or administrative panel. While litigation is sometimes necessary, I also know when mediation or arbitration is the correct path to victory for my clients.\nMy core practice areas include, civil litigation (including, personal injury),, family law (divorce, child support and alimony, custody and parental rights cases, adoption, guardianships), landlord-tenant, estate planning (Wills, Trusts, Powers of Attorney), criminal record annulments (clears criminal record).\nI am admitted to practice in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, including the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire. I am a member of the New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bar Associations. In 2013, I was chosen to participate in the New Hampshire Bar Leadership Academy, a select group chosen by the Bar to promote and encourage leadership and professionalism by identifying present and future leaders of the New Hampshire Bar. Prior to attending law school, I received a B.A. in Psychology and a B.A in Behavioral Science, both with High Honors from Cedarville University in 1992, and was included in the 1992 Who s Who in American Colleges and Universities.\nI grew up outside of Milwaukee and have been a New Hampshire resident since 1993. I currently live in Dover with my wife, five children and Bernese Mountain Dog.\nAt Simmons & Ortlieb, P.L.L.C., we seek to build long-term relationships with our clients and we help our clients with a broad range of their legal needs.\nExplore\nHome\nAbout Us\nServices\nClient Testimonials\nContact Us\nBusiness Law\nCivil Litigation\nCriminal Litigation\nEstate Planning\nLand Use\nPersonal Injury\nFacebook\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\n2017 Simmons & Ortlieb PLLC.\nLaw office website design by High Effect Design NH\nTop","annotation":[{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6998,"end":7019,"text":"Simmons & Ortlieb PLLC"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6942,"end":6956,"text":"Personal Injury"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6933,"end":6940,"text":"Land Use"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6917,"end":6931,"text":"Estate Planning"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6897,"end":6904,"text":"Criminal"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6880,"end":6895,"text":"Civil Litigation"}]},{"label":["LAW_CAT"],"points":[{"start":6867,"end":6878,"text":"Business Law"}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":6653,"end":6679,"text":"Simmons & Ortlieb, P.L.L.C."}]},{"label":["ORG"],"points":[{"start":4464,"end":4489,"text":"John Anthony Simmons, PLLC"}]},{"label":["TITLE"],"points":[{"start":3993,"end":3999,"text":"Esquire"}]},{"label":["PERSON"],"points":[{"start":3973,"end":3990,"text":"Michael J.

I defended insurance companies in lawsuits brought by their policyholders. This work gave me insightful knowledge, but I was very unhappy and unfulfilled. After years of what I felt was the wrong side of justice, I left big corporate law firm life to help people on the other side -- to make a difference in the lives of those who most need skilled legal support.\nI m happiest when I m fighting for justice against big firms that think they re untouchable. When people are at the lowest points in their lives, injured, depressed, and worried about their futures, I step in to make a difference in their lives. I m there to help take away their fears, loneliness and pain, to let them know they re no longer in this fight alone. I love being a trial lawyer. I am devoted to becoming the best person and lawyer that I can be. That s why I fight for justice with all of my heart and soul, and stay fully committed to my clients.\nMy firm takes a limited number of cases, so I can personally devote a tremendous amount of time and care to each client. I get to know my clients and their families very well. I can only help my clients if I truly know them and understand them. That s why I spend a lot of time visiting my clients at their homes and elsewhere. I take every case very seriously, because the outcome of each case can affect the lives of thousands of families across America. I don t settle clients, cases quickly and cheaply to earn easy money. Every member of my firm works hard to do everything possible to obtain all of the justice the law allows for each client.\nMy team and I thank you for visiting our site and we encourage you to call us with any questions for a free consultation at (626) 243-5598 or, send us an inquiry form online.\nFree Consultation, (626) 243-5598, 6262435598)\nN a\nLaw Offices of Scott Glovsky\nClaremont Office\n343 Harvard Avenue\nClaremont, CA 91711\nGet Directions\nTel:, (626) 243-5598, 6262435598, Phone )\nPasadena Office\n100 East Corson Street,\nSuite 200\nPasadena, CA 91103\nGet Directions\n(By Appointment Only)\nMore Information\nHome\nHealth Insurance Denial\nBad Faith Insurance\nMedical Necessity Denials\nResources\nLos Angeles Insurance Law Explained\nPasadena Personal Injury Law Explained\nLos Angeles ERISA Lawyer\nPersonal Injury Law Trial\nCopyright (C) Scott Glovsky 2019.
